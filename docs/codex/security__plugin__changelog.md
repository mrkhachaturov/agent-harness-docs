# Codex Security plugin changelog

Use this changelog to see what changed in Codex Security and which plugin
versions are available from each installation source.

**Latest release in the hosted Codex Security catalog:** `0.1.12`.

**Latest release in the public Codex CLI plugin marketplace:** `0.1.11`.

Check the plugin version in your current Codex environment before you use a
feature from a newer release. Reopening or rerunning a saved scan doesn't pin
the installed plugin version.

These versions apply to the Codex Security plugin. The Codex app, Codex CLI,
TypeScript SDK, and plugin app have separate version numbers.

## 0.1.12 (July 23, 2026)

### Run deeper scans with clearer progress

- Run deep scans that coordinate workers across an entire repository
  or a selected directory.
- Carry your model and reasoning settings into delegated scan work.
- See preflight results, scan progress, available worker capacity, and fallback
  behavior before and during a scan.

### Review and rerun previous scans

- Open current and previous scans from the security scan list.
- Reopen a saved scan in the findings workspace, or rerun it to refresh the
  results.
- See clearer completion states and more consistent finding details and scan
  history.

### Configure scans with fewer interruptions

- Start scans from the native setup flow without leaving your current task.
- Keep scan setup in the side panel, even when Codex is in full-screen mode.
- Dismiss setup when you don't need it and keep that preference for later
  scans.

### Review and remediate validated findings

- Keep validated low-severity findings in completed results.
- Review more consistent finding details across scans, reports, and exports.
- Retry remediation and carry relevant scan context into follow-up fixes.

### Export results for existing security workflows

- Export completed findings as JSON, CSV, or SARIF.
- Generate SARIF results locally for code-scanning and security-tool
  integrations.
- Preserve consistent finding details across exported formats.

## 0.1.11 (July 10, 2026)

### Produce detailed finding and hardening reports

- Generate one source-backed vulnerability report for every reportable scan
  finding, with supporting proof-of-concept files when available.
- Review a structural hardening portfolio that analyzes the complete finding
  set, engineering tradeoffs, migration options, and supporting diagrams.
- Use `report.md` as the entry point to these derived outputs under `findings/`
  and `hardening/`. Keep the full scan directory together when sharing or
  archiving results.

### Run reporting workflows directly

- Use `$codex-security:vulnerability-writeup` to turn disclosure documents,
  rough findings, PoCs, and source code into polished reports without first
  running a Codex Security scan.
- Use `$codex-security:propose-security-hardening` to develop evidence-backed
  structural or architectural options from scans, findings, incident or
  assessment documents, and source code.

### Apply repository guidance and coverage consistently

- Define threat-model context, security invariants, reportable finding
  criteria, exclusions, and severity context in root or nested `SECURITY.md`
  files. The closest applicable file takes precedence.
- Improve repository review coverage before validation while preserving
  explicitly deferred surfaces and proof gaps.
- Review deleted source files in change scans and expand the default repository
  review coverage before validation.
- Check deep-scan phase skills, delegated workers, and worker capacity before a
  deep scan starts.

## 0.1.10 (June 23, 2026)

### Improve Jira and Linear ticket intake

- Ask before importing Linear sub-issues and preserve parent-child
  relationships in the results.
- Distinguish missing connections, insufficient permissions, inaccessible
  tickets, and temporary connector failures.
- Stop instead of creating a verdict when the requested ticket content isn't
  available.
- Assign unique positive integer ranks starting at `1` within each confirmed
  or needs-review queue.

### Review code changes more reliably

- Compare an inspected commit with its actual parent and preserve the diff
  target in the findings workspace.
- Report unavailable patch state instead of reviewing a different change.
- Review more consistent triage results and finding context.

## 0.1.9 (June 18, 2026)

### Review scans in the findings workspace

- Review completed scans in a dedicated workspace that brings findings,
  coverage, severity, confidence, and scan artifacts together.
- Filter and sort findings, including sorting by highest confidence, while
  preserving your workspace state during refreshes.
- Open a finding to review source evidence, validation details, reachability,
  impact, and remediation guidance in one place.

### Run scans with less setup

- Run standard scans against Git repositories, individual folders, or
  codebases without Git history. Deep scans can also target a specific folder.
- Cancel an active scan explicitly, resume an interrupted scan without another
  setup prompt, and receive a warning before starting concurrent deep scans.
- Follow clearer setup and progress states, with more compact progress
  summaries and errors that remain visible until you address them.

### Export portable, verifiable results

- Use a consistent completed-scan format with a manifest, structured findings,
  coverage data, and a Markdown report derived from the same canonical result.
- Export findings as JSON, CSV, or SARIF for analysis, archiving, and integration
  with other security tools.
- Complete scans more reliably, including when Windows paths or scan locking
  affect filesystem access.

### Triage and track existing findings

- Triage existing findings from scanners, advisories, bug bounty reports,
  GitHub, Jira, Linear, or Codex Security results against the current codebase.
  The triage workflow returns an evidence-backed verdict and a prioritized
  action queue.
- Track selected validated findings in Linear, Jira, or GitHub issues, or create
  a private draft GitHub Security Advisory when the repository meets the
  advisory requirements.
- Review duplicate checks, source context, destination visibility, and the
  exact proposed content before approving a write. Codex reads the result back
  after creation or update to verify it.

## 0.1.7 (June 4, 2026)

### Run evidence-backed security reviews

- Scan an authorized repository or selected folder for security
  vulnerabilities.
- Run repeated discovery across an entire repository when you need more
  thorough coverage.
- Review pull requests, commits, branch differences, and local patches for
  security regressions.
- Move each candidate through threat modeling, finding discovery, validation,
  and impact analysis before generating scan reports.
- Fix one accepted finding with a focused patch, regression coverage, and
  verification of the original issue.
