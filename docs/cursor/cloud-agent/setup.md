# Cloud Environment Setup

Cloud agents run on isolated Ubuntu machines. Configure the environment so the agent has the same repos, tools, dependencies, secrets, and network access a developer would use.

Create a new environment in your [Cloud Agents dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard/cloud-agents#environments).

## What is a cloud agent environment?

The development environment for a cloud agent is similar to the setup on your laptop: cloned repos, installed dependencies, secrets, startup commands, and network access.

Effective development environments give agents full context on your codebase and organization, so they can test and verify their work.

## Why does environment configuration matter?

Agents are only as capable as the environments they run in. An agent that can write code but can't run tests, query services, or reach APIs cannot close the loop on its work.

To take engineering tasks from start to finish, cloud agents need a configured development environment with all the repositories, tools, dependencies, and context to stay autonomous and productive.

Development environments also make agent sessions faster because cloud agents start with the tools installed instead of setting up from scratch every time.

Environment setup is the most important step to improve the effectiveness of your cloud agents.

## Environment setup options

There are two main ways to configure the environment for your cloud agent:

1. Let Cursor's agent set up its own environment from the [Cloud Agents dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard/cloud-agents#environments). After the agent is done, you will have the option to create a snapshot of its virtual machine that can be reused for future agents.
2. Manually configure the environment with a Dockerfile. If you choose this option, you can specify the Dockerfile in a `.cursor/environment.json` file.

Both options generate an environment, and also allow you to specify an update command that will be run before the agent starts to ensure that its dependencies are up to date (e.g. `npm install`, `pip install`, etc.).

### Multi-repo environments

Use a multi-repo environment when an agent needs to work across more than one repository. Select multiple repositories when you create the environment. Cursor clones each selected repo into the agent machine and reuses the environment for future agent runs and automations that use the same repo group.

Multi-repo environments are useful when your frontend, backend, infrastructure, or shared libraries live in separate repos. The agent can inspect the full workspace, make coordinated changes, run tests across repos, and open pull requests in the repos it changes.

You can see which environment is active, along with all past active versions, by visiting the environment's configuration page on the [Cloud Agents dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard/cloud-agents#environments).

### Environment resolution order

Cursor resolves environment configuration by repository or repo group, using the first match:

1. `.cursor/environment.json` in the repository
2. A personal saved environment
3. A team saved environment

This gives you predictable defaults at the team level while still letting individual users override with a personal environment when a repo-level `.cursor/environment.json` is not present. User overrides are also useful to allow testing out a new environment configuration before rolling it out to the entire team.

### Agent-driven setup (recommended)

Cursor can set up your dev environment in the cloud in less than 10 minutes. Start guided setup from the [Cloud Agents dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard/cloud-agents#environments) or from the [Agents Window](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/agents-window.md) in the Cursor desktop app.

You will be asked to connect your GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, or Bitbucket account and select one or more repositories.

Then, you provide Cursor with the environment variables and secrets it will need to install dependencies and run the code.

As the agent works, you can watch its progress in a shared terminal session while it handles setup tasks like installing dependencies. After Cursor has installed dependencies and verified the code is working, you can save a snapshot of its virtual machine.

![Cloud environment setup in a shared terminal session](https://ptht05hbb1ssoooe.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/assets/changelog/cloud-environment-setup.png)

The snapshot is reusable, so future cloud agents start up faster and can test changes by running your software. Commit the configuration to `.cursor/environment.json` so your whole team benefits.

### Manual setup with Dockerfile (advanced)

For advanced cases, configure the environment with a Dockerfile:

- Create a Dockerfile to install system-level dependencies, use specific compiler versions, install debuggers, or switch the base OS image
- Do not `COPY` the full project; Cursor manages the workspace and checks out the correct commit
- Edit `.cursor/environment.json` directly to configure runtime settings
- Use build secrets for private package registries or build-time credentials

Here's an example `.cursor/environment.json` referencing a `.cursor/Dockerfile` (relative path) and a `custom_script.sh` install script:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "dockerfile": "Dockerfile",
    "context": ".."
  },
  "install": "pnpm install && ./custom_script.sh"
}
```

If your repo needs Docker, Tailscale, or Cloudflare Tunnel, see [Running Docker](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/setup.md#running-docker), [Running Tailscale](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/setup.md#running-tailscale), and [Running Cloudflare Tunnel](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/setup.md#running-cloudflare-tunnel) below.

You configure the environment with a Dockerfile; you do not get direct access to the remote machine.

Dockerfile builds use layer caching. When you change a Dockerfile, Cursor rebuilds the changed layers instead of rebuilding every layer from scratch.

### Cursor-configured Dockerfiles (private beta)

For teams that do not want to write a Dockerfile from scratch, Cursor can configure one for you. During setup, Cursor inspects your repos, identifies tools and dependencies, and produces a Dockerfile-based environment configuration you can edit and version.

This flow is in private beta for Enterprise teams. To request access, contact your Cursor account representative or email [hi@cursor.com](mailto:hi@cursor.com) from your team admin account.

### Computer Use Support for Dockerfile Repos

Computer use is supported for repos with Dockerfiles based on Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux distributions. If you require support for a different Linux distribution, please contact support.

### Resource limits

Each cloud agent runs on a default VM profile with limited memory and CPU. If you are on an Enterprise plan and your repo needs more resources, contact support and we can increase limits for your workspace.

Self-serve custom resource configuration is coming soon.

## Update command

When a new machine boots, Cursor starts from the base environment, then runs the `update` command (called `install` in `environment.json`).

For most repos, the `update` script is `npm install`, `bazel build`, or a similar dependency setup command.

### Update script idempotency

The `update` script must be idempotent. It can run more than once, and it may run on partially cached state.

### How caching works

After `update` completes, if it took more than a few seconds to run, Cursor will take an internal checkpoint snapshot and will attempt to start future cloud agents from this checkpoint.

This is why `update` commands like `pnpm install` usually lead to fast startup - if dependencies changed, the command only needs to do incremental work.

Caching is best effort; you may see slower startup times on infrequently used repositories.

### Environment configuration recovery

Agents no longer hard fail when Cursor can recover from an environment configuration issue. Saved environments often start from a snapshot. If the requested snapshot cannot be used, Cursor falls back to the default base image and warns you.

Cursor falls back when:

- The snapshot expired after inactivity
- The snapshot is invalid or failed
- You do not have access to the snapshot

When fallback happens, Cursor keeps the rest of the environment configuration and swaps the image back to the default base image. The `update` command still runs, so dependency setup can repair the environment during startup.

The agent view shows **Environment ready (with warnings)** and a warning banner explaining what happened. The warning stays visible in the conversation as an environment configuration issue card. Open setup from the warning to inspect or repair the environment.

Cursor does not automatically switch to an older saved environment version. If you want to roll back the saved configuration, open the environment from the [Cloud Agents dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard/cloud-agents), review **Version history**, and restore a previous version.

### How to decide what to put in your `update` script

There is a tradeoff between caching work in `update` and doing setup on demand during a run.

Placing infrequently run or expensive commands (such as starting services or building docker images) in `update` can slow down startup time.

A practical pattern is to run basic cached dependency updates (such as `pnpm install`) in your `update` script, then [adding instructions in AGENTS.md](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/setup.md#add-cloud-specific-instructions-to-agentsmd) so the agent can figure out which commands it needs to run for each specific task.

## Startup commands

After `install`, the machine starts and runs the `start` command, then any configured `terminals`. Use this to start processes that should stay alive while the agent runs.

You can skip `start` in many repos. If your environment depends on Docker, add `sudo service docker start` in `start`.

`terminals` are for app code processes. These terminals run in a `tmux` session shared by you and the agent.

## Add cloud-specific instructions to `AGENTS.md`

Cloud agents read `AGENTS.md` files. We recommend adding a dedicated section for Cloud-only setup and testing instructions, with a title such as `Cursor Cloud specific instructions`.

If this section gets large, we recommend including references to other files that can contain detailed instructions for specific tasks.

See our [AGENTS.md docs](https://cursor.com/docs/rules.md#agentsmd) for more information.

## Environment variables and secrets

In order to fully run and test code like a human developer, Cloud agents often need environment variables and secrets such as API keys and database credentials.

### Recommended: use the Secrets tab in Cursor settings

The easiest way to manage secrets is through [cursor.com](https://cursor.com/dashboard/cloud-agents). These are exposed to the cloud agent as environment variables.

For more about the different types of secrets, see our [Secrets documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/security-network.md#secret-protection).

### Environment-scoped secrets

Use environment-scoped secrets when a credential should only be available to agents that use one environment. This is useful for multi-repo environments, staging credentials, or repository groups with different access needs.

Environment-scoped secrets apply to every repo in that environment. They are not available to other environments.

### Sign-in credentials and 2FA

If your app requires login, add the same credentials you use locally as secrets, such as a username, email, and password.

If your login flow uses TOTP-based 2FA, add the TOTP secret, sometimes called the shared or root secret, as a secret too. The agent can generate the current 6-digit code with `oathtool --totp -b "$TOTP_SECRET"`.

### Monorepos with multiple `.env` files

If your monorepo has multiple `.env.local` files:

- Add values from all `.env.local` files to the same Secrets tab
- Use unique variable names when keys overlap, such as `NEXTJS_*` and `CONVEX_*`
- Reference those variables from each app as needed

If you include `.env.local` files while taking a snapshot, they can be saved and available to cloud agents. The Secrets tab remains the recommended approach for security and management.

### Using AWS IAM Roles

Cursor supports assuming customer-provided IAM roles for deeper integration with AWS. This allows you to grant specific AWS permissions to cloud agents without sharing long-lived credentials.

1. **Create the IAM role**: In your AWS account, create the IAM role that you'd like the cloud agent to assume, and note its ARN (e.g. `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/acmeRole`).

2. **Configure the IAM role secret**: Navigate to [Cursor Dashboard → Cloud Agents](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=cloud-agents), and add a user or team secret named `CURSOR_AWS_ASSUME_IAM_ROLE_ARN` set to the ARN of the IAM role you created.

3. **Generate an external ID**: A team admin must do this from the **Advanced** section of team settings. Navigate to [Cursor Dashboard → Settings → Advanced](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=settings) and find the External ID settings. If you don't see an external ID displayed, enter a placeholder value in the "AWS IAM Role ARN" field, click "Validate & Save", and reload the page. This will generate an external ID for your team (e.g. `cursor-xxx-yyy-zzz`).

4. **Configure IAM role trust policy**: In your AWS account, update the IAM role's trust policy to trust Cursor's role assumer. The trust policy should look like this:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowCursorAssume",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::289469326074:role/roleAssumer"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "cursor-xxx-yyy-zzz"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace `cursor-xxx-yyy-zzz` with the external ID generated for your team.

**Environment variables:**

When configured, Cursor sets these environment variables so AWS tooling uses the `cursor-cloud-agent` profile:

- `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` points to a Cursor-managed AWS config file
- `AWS_PROFILE` is set to `cursor-cloud-agent`
- `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG` is set to `1`

The AWS CLI and AWS SDKs that use the default credential chain pick up this profile automatically during setup commands and while the agent is running. You don't need to export `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, or `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` yourself.

Cursor assumes the role with STS credentials that expire after 1 hour.
When the agent wakes, Cursor refreshes credentials that are missing, invalid, or within 15 minutes of expiration.

## Configuration in code with environment.json

If you prefer to keep your environment configuration defined in code, you can commit a `.cursor/environment.json` to your repository.

Cloud agents will use the configuration at the commit they start from, so to test a new configuration, you can commit and push the change to a new branch, and start a cloud agent from that branch.

Sample `environment.json` using a snapshot-based config (the snapshot ID is accessible from the environments page of the dashboard):

```json
{
  "snapshot": "snapshot-20260212-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "install": "npm install"
}
```

Here is a sample `.cursor/environment.json` referencing a `.cursor/Dockerfile` (relative path) and a `custom_script.sh` install script:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "dockerfile": "Dockerfile",
    "context": ".."
  },
  "install": "pnpm install && ./custom_script.sh"
}
```

### Important path behavior

The `dockerfile` and `context` paths in `build` are relative to `.cursor`. When
you omit `context`, it defaults to `.cursor`. The values `.`, `./`, and `..` are
special-cased to mean the repository root rather than `.cursor`, so to `COPY`
files that live in `.cursor` with bare filenames, omit `context`. The `install`
command runs from your project root.

The full schema is [defined here](https://www.cursor.com/schemas/environment.schema.json).

## Running Docker

Cloud agents support Docker workflows. We use this internally for full-stack repos that run many services.

For simple setups, installing Docker is often enough. Commands like `docker run hello-world` usually work once Docker is installed and the daemon is running.

Docker has edge cases in Cloud Agents because it runs inside another container layer. Simple workflows usually work. More complex setups should start from the `fuse-overlayfs` and `iptables-legacy` configuration below.

For more complex Docker setups, use `fuse-overlayfs`, `iptables-legacy`, and make sure your cloud agent user can run Docker.

### Recommended Dockerfile for complex Docker setups

```

## Running Tailscale

Tailscale does not work in its default networking mode in Cloud agent VMs. Use userspace networking mode instead.

This lets the agent reach private services and data stores through your tailnet without exposing those services to the public internet.

Start `tailscaled` with:

```bash
tailscaled --tun=userspace-networking \
  --outbound-http-proxy-listen=localhost:1054 \
  --socks5-server=localhost:1055
```

Then export these proxy variables in the shell where you want traffic to flow through Tailscale:

```bash
export ALL_PROXY=socks5h://localhost:1055/
export HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:1054/
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:1054/
```

After that, run your usual `tailscale up ...` flow.

If you want a working reference, some customers have used [`tailscale-orb`](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/orbiously/tailscale#commands-connect) successfully because its Docker mode follows this pattern.

Userspace networking does not let the VM appear as a tailnet exit node.

## Running Cloudflare Tunnel

Cloudflare Tunnel works in Cloud Agent VMs because `cloudflared` runs in userspace.

Use this pattern when a Cloud Agent needs to reach a private HTTP service in a VPC or intranet:

- Install `cloudflared` in your environment Dockerfile or update script.
- Run a `cloudflared` connector inside your private network.
- Route an authenticated hostname, such as `vpc.example.com`, through the tunnel to the private origin.
- Add that hostname to the Cloud Agent network allowlist if your environment uses restricted egress.
- Store the Cloudflare Access service token values as Cursor Secrets. For example, use `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` and `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET`.

The Cloud Agent can then call the private service over normal HTTPS with the `CF-Access-Client-Id` and `CF-Access-Client-Secret` headers. The connector makes the outbound connection to Cloudflare and forwards the request to your private origin. Your services and data stores stay on your private network, and the connector does not need inbound ports open.

For private TCP services, such as databases, configure a Cloudflare TCP Access app and run `cloudflared access tcp` in your startup command. Point your app or test command at the local listener that `cloudflared` creates.

Keep tunnel tokens and Access service token secrets in Cursor Secrets, not in
your repository. Rotate them after testing if they were created for a proof of
concept.
