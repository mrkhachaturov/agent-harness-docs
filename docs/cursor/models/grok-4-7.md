Grok 4.7 is a frontier model from Cursor and SpaceXAI for coding and knowledge work. It builds on Grok 4.6 with a larger base, longer training on harder multi-hour tasks, and stronger self-verification.

## Strengths

- Stays with difficult, long-running work and checks its own results more carefully than Grok 4.6.
- Manages longer context more reliably, with a 256k standard window and 500k long context.
- Stronger on complex coding and multi-hour knowledge work.

## Effort levels

Grok 4.7 supports four effort levels: xhigh, high (default), medium, and low. Higher effort gives the model more time to work through difficult tasks. Effort levels are more separated than in Grok 4.6, so harder tasks spend more time thinking.

Fast is the default speed tier on Pro and higher plans. On the [Start plan](https://cursor.com/docs/models-and-pricing.md#start-india-only) (India only), Grok 4.7 is fixed at medium effort at standard speed.

## Tools

Grok 4.7 has access to all agent tools when used with Cursor, including:

## Pricing

Grok 4.7 is part of the [Cursor Models pool](https://cursor.com/docs/models-and-pricing.md#cursor-models) on individual and team plans. This pool also includes Grok 4.6, Grok 4.5, and Composer 2.5.

Standard on-demand usage is priced at $2/M input tokens, $0.50/M cached input tokens, and $6/M output tokens. Fast is $4/M input, $1/M cached, and $12/M output. When input exceeds 256k tokens, standard requests bill at 2x those rates and Fast requests bill at 3x the standard rates, up to a 500k context window. Long-context billing uses the input length only: if input is at or below 256k tokens, the full request uses the standard or Fast rates. All prices are per million tokens.
