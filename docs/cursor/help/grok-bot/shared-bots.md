# Shared Bots

A Bot is either personal or shared. Share a Bot with your Cursor team the way you'd share a doc: with everyone on the team, or only with certain people and groups. Sharing doesn't make a copy, and each person's chat with a shared Bot is private.

Shared Bots always run in the cloud. A Bot that runs on your own computer can't be shared.

## Who can use shared Bots?

Shared Bots are for members of a Cursor team who have Grok Bot. Choose **+** in the sidebar to see **Create a Bot** and **Browse shared Bots**. If **Browse shared Bots** isn't there, you aren't on a Cursor team, or your Grok Bot app needs an update.

## How do I create a Bot for my team?

1. Choose **+** in the sidebar, then **Create a Bot**, and give it a name.
2. Tell the Bot what it should help the team with. A sentence is enough.
3. Follow its setup steps for apps, secrets, skills, and files. Only add keys and files you're happy for everyone you share it with to use.
4. Share it. See [How do I share a Bot with my team?](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/shared-bots.md#how-do-i-share-a-bot-with-my-team)

You can also share a Bot you already have. Sharing doesn't duplicate it. Before you share, check its apps, secrets, skills, and files, since they work in every teammate's chat.

## How do I share a Bot with my team?

Click the Bot's name at the top of the chat and choose **Share**. In **Share this Bot**:

- Under **Who has access**, choose your team to share the Bot with everyone on the team, or **People you invite** to share it only with the people and groups you add. Limiting it asks you to confirm with **Limit access**. The owner and Managers can always use the Bot.
- Choose **Add people or groups** to add someone. Under **Add as**, pick **Collaborator** to let them chat with the Bot, or **Manager** to let them also change how it works: its instructions, skills, memory, and apps.

To stop sharing, open **Share** again and remove access.

## How do teammates find a shared Bot?

- Choose **+** in the sidebar, then **Browse shared Bots**. The list shows Bots shared with you, and each one shows who made it. Choose **Add** to keep a Bot in your sidebar.
- On your phone, tap **+**, then **Browse shared Bots**.
- Open a link a teammate sent you, then choose **Start a chat**.

A shared Bot's link opens the same Bot for everyone. It's different from [sharing a Bot template](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/work.md#share-a-bot), which gives each person their own copy.

## Can the owner see my chats with a shared Bot?

No. Each person's chat with a shared Bot is private. The owner and Managers can't read your chats, and you can't read the owner's or anyone else's.

The Bot can save things it learns for the whole team, and it tells you when it does. It doesn't save anything about you personally for the team. What it remembers about working with you stays between you and the Bot.

## Whose apps and secrets does a shared Bot use?

A shared Bot uses the apps and secrets its owner added. Those work the same for everyone who chats with it.

In your own chat with a shared Bot, it can also use your apps. It asks before it uses one of your personal accounts. The card says **Allow**, then the app name:

- **Allow once** lets it use that account this time.
- **Always allow** remembers your answer. Its menu has **Always allow for your messages to this Bot** and **Always allow for your messages to every Shared Bot**.
- **Skip** means it doesn't use that account this time.

In Slack channels, threads, and group chats, a shared Bot uses only its owner's apps, and asks before it uses your accounts.

A connected account always acts as the person the Bot is answering. One teammate's connection is never used for someone else.

To make every shared Bot ask again, open **Settings** > **General** > **Shared Bots** and choose **Clear** next to **Clear connector preferences**.

## Which computer does a shared Bot use?

In your own chat with a teammate's shared Bot, the Bot usually works on your Grok Bot computer. That means it can use the files there and the sites you're signed in to there. Sometimes it uses a separate computer just for that conversation, for example when your privacy mode is stricter than the owner's.

When you DM a shared Bot in Slack, it also works on your own computer. In Slack channels, threads, group DMs, and group chats, a shared Bot uses one shared computer of its own.

## Whose usage pays for a shared Bot chat?

A shared Bot reply uses the Grok Bot usage of the person it's answering. That's true in your own chat, in Slack, and in group chats. Your own limits apply. The owner's usage pays for the owner's own messages, and for Slack posts from apps or workflows that aren't linked to a Cursor account. See [Plans and billing](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/plans.md).

## How do approvals work on a shared Bot?

A shared Bot asks the person it's answering before risky actions.

- In your own chat with a shared Bot, you answer its approval cards.
- In a Slack thread, the Bot posts a **Review an action** card with **Allow once**, **Deny**, and **View details**. Only the person who asked can answer it.
- In a group chat, only the person whose message the Bot is answering can answer.

It also asks before it uses your personal accounts. See [Whose apps and secrets does a shared Bot use?](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/shared-bots.md#whose-apps-and-secrets-does-a-shared-bot-use)

## How do I add a shared Bot to Slack?

The owner or a Manager adds it, after sharing:

1. Click the Bot's name at the top of the chat.
2. Find **Bring to your team's Slack** and choose **Connect**.
3. If it says **Awaiting admin approval**, a Slack workspace admin needs to approve the app.

Once it says **Connected**, teammates can message the Bot directly or mention it in channels.

In a channel thread or a DM, the shared Bot acts for the teammate who mentioned it. It can hand work to that person's own Bots, and their replies are posted back into the same thread. A personal Bot doesn't hand work to other Bots from a channel thread. See [Can a Bot message other Bots from Slack?](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/group-chats.md#can-a-bot-message-other-bots-from-slack)

Bots record who asked for each message they post in Slack, so anyone in the thread can ask the Bot who requested it. When a shared Bot's routine replies in a Slack thread, the Bot follows that thread and answers later replies without an @mention.

Each teammate needs to link their Slack account first. Open **Settings** > **General** > **Shared Bots** and choose **Link**. If you message the Bot before you link, it replies with steps to link your account.

## How do I edit or delete a shared Bot?

The owner and the Bot's Managers can change a shared Bot. Click the Bot's name at the top of the chat to open its details, or choose the wrench at the top right to open **Bot settings**:

- **Plugins** (the Bot's connected apps), **Secrets**, **Skills**, and **Files** hold what the Bot uses for everyone.
- Click the name to rename the Bot. Edit the description under **About**.
- **Share** controls who can use the Bot and who manages it.

The owner can also rename the Bot by right-clicking it in the sidebar and choosing **Rename Bot**.

Only the owner can delete a shared Bot. Right-click the Bot in the sidebar and choose **Delete**. This deletes the Bot for your whole team. Teammates lose it, along with their chats and routines on it. It can't be undone.

## How do I remove a shared Bot from my sidebar?

Right-click the Bot and choose **Hide from sidebar**. To add it back, choose **+** in the sidebar, then **Browse shared Bots**, and choose **Add** next to it.

If your admin added the Bot to your sidebar for you, **Hide from sidebar** isn't in its menu, and you can't remove it.

## Can I use shared Bots on my phone?

Yes. Shared Bots you've added appear in the phone app. To find another, tap **+**, then **Browse shared Bots**. You can chat with shared Bots and answer their **Allow** cards. A shared Bot can't be your primary Bot.

## Can I voice chat with a teammate's shared Bot?

Yes, on desktop. In your own chat with the Bot, choose **Start voice chat**. See [Voice chat with a Bot](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/voice-chat.md).

## Can a shared Bot join a group chat?

Yes. You can add a Bot a teammate shared with you to your own group chat. It can't share a group with Bots that run on your own computer. See [Group chats and Bot-to-Bot messages](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/group-chats.md).

## How do admins manage shared Bots?

On the Grok Bot page of the [Cursor dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard/bot), open **Manage Shared Bots** under **Shared Bots**.

- **Access** shows who can use each shared Bot. Click it to change who can use the Bot.
- **Auto-add** puts the Bot in members' sidebars automatically. Pick **All team** or one or more groups. Those members can't hide it. Auto-add only applies to groups that have access.

See [Grok Bot for Teams and Enterprise](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/teams.md#manage-shared-bots).

If none of these match, [contact support](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/get-help.md) with the Bot's name, the exact message, and your Grok Bot version.
