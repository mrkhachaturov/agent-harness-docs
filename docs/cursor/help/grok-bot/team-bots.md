# Team Bots

A Bot is either personal or shared. Share a Bot the way you'd share a doc: with your Cursor team, your whole organization, or only certain people and groups. Sharing doesn't make a copy, and each person's chat with a Team Bot is private.

Team Bots always run in the cloud. A Bot that runs on your own computer can't be shared. A few screens, such as **Browse shared Bots**, still say shared Bots. They're the same thing.

## Who can use Team Bots?

Team Bots are for members of a Cursor team who have Grok Bot. Choose **+** in the sidebar to see **Create a Bot** and **Browse shared Bots**. If **Browse shared Bots** isn't there, you aren't on a Cursor team, or your Grok Bot app needs an update.

In Slack, members of your workspace who aren't on the team can sometimes use a Team Bot too. See [Who can talk to a Team Bot in Slack?](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/team-bots.md#who-can-talk-to-a-team-bot-in-slack)

## How do I create a Bot for my team?

1. Choose **+** in the sidebar, then **Create a Bot**, and give it a name.
2. Tell the Bot what it should help the team with. A sentence is enough.
3. Follow its setup steps for apps, secrets, skills, and files. Only add keys and files you're happy for everyone you share it with to use. Until you publish it, it's a draft only you can see.
4. When the Bot says it's ready to share, choose **Publish**. Teammates can then find it. To change who has access, see [How do I share a Bot with my team?](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/team-bots.md#how-do-i-share-a-bot-with-my-team)

You can also share a Bot you already have. Sharing doesn't duplicate it. Before you share, check its apps, secrets, skills, and files, since they work in every teammate's chat.

## How do I share a Bot with my team?

Click the Bot's name at the top of the chat and choose **Share**. In **Share this Bot**:

- Under **Who has access**, choose **Only you**, **People you invite**, your team, or your organization. **People you invite** shares the Bot only with the people and groups you add. Limiting access asks you to confirm with **Limit access**. The owner and Managers can always use the Bot.
- Choose **Add people or groups** to add someone. Under **Add as**, pick **Collaborator** to let them chat with the Bot, or **Manager** to let them also change how it works: its instructions, skills, memory, and apps.
- Choose **Copy link** to send teammates a link to the Bot.

To stop sharing, open **Share** again and choose **Only you**, or remove people's access.

## Who can share Bots?

Anyone on the team, unless an admin changes it. On the Grok Bot page of the team dashboard, **Bot sharing** under **Sharing** is set to **Everyone** or **Admins only**. With **Admins only**, **Share** is disabled for members and shows **Only team admins can share Bots**. Bots that were already shared stay shared, and their owners and Managers can still use them. Ask an admin to share a Bot for you, or to change the setting. See [How do admins manage Team Bots?](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/team-bots.md#how-do-admins-manage-team-bots)

## How do teammates find a Team Bot?

- Choose **+** in the sidebar, then **Browse shared Bots**. The list shows Bots shared with you, and each one shows who made it. Choose **Add** to keep a Bot in your sidebar.
- Press Cmd+K on Mac or Ctrl+K on Windows and choose **Browse shared Bots**. The list starts with **Popular** Bots, and you can search it.
- Ask your Bot which Team Bot can help with something. It searches the Team Bots you can use and recommends ones you haven't opened.
- On your phone, tap **+**, then **Browse shared Bots**.
- Open a link a teammate sent you, then choose **Start a chat**.

A Team Bot's link opens the same Bot for everyone. It's different from [sharing a Bot template](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/work.md#share-a-bot), which gives each person their own copy.

## Can the owner see my chats with a Team Bot?

No. Each person's chat with a Team Bot is private. The owner and Managers can't read your chats, and you can't read the owner's or anyone else's.

The Bot can learn things for the whole team. What it learns from a teammate waits until the owner or a Manager approves it under **Review learnings**. It doesn't save anything about you personally for the team. What it remembers about working with you stays between you and the Bot. See [What does a Team Bot learn for the team?](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/memory.md#what-does-a-team-bot-learn-for-the-team)

## Whose apps and secrets does a Team Bot use?

A Team Bot uses the apps and secrets its owner added. Those work the same for everyone who chats with it.

In your own chat with a Team Bot, it can also use your apps. It asks before it uses one of your personal accounts. The card says **Allow**, then the app name:

- **Allow once** lets it use that account this time.
- **Always allow** remembers your answer. Its menu has **Always allow for your messages to this Bot** and **Always allow for your messages to every Team Bot**.
- **Skip** means it doesn't use that account this time.

In Slack channels, threads, and group chats, a Team Bot uses only its owner's apps, and asks before it uses your accounts.

A connected account acts as the person the Bot is answering. One teammate's connection is never used for someone else, unless a Manager shares it as a shared connector.

To make every Team Bot ask again, open **Settings** > **General** > **Team Bots** and choose **Clear** next to **Clear connector preferences**.

## How do shared connectors work?

A shared connector lets everyone use an app through one account, so teammates don't each have to connect it. The owner or a Manager sets it up: open the Bot's details and, under **Setup**, choose **Service accounts**. Pick an app under **Shared connectors**, then choose how the Bot signs in to it:

- **Use individual accounts**: each teammate connects their own.
- **Share your account**: everyone who uses the Bot acts through your account, including to make changes. Connect the app for yourself first, and only share an account that holds nothing sensitive or private.
- The Bot's own account: a separate account the Bot uses for the team. Some apps don't support this yet.

Sharing your account needs a team admin to turn on **Allow Shared Logins** first. Until then, the Bot says **Your admin has turned off sharing logins with Bots**. See [How do admins manage Team Bots?](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/team-bots.md#how-do-admins-manage-team-bots)

The app's row shows whose account the Bot uses. To stop, choose **Stop sharing**, or remove the app. Teammates then connect their own.

## Which computer does a Team Bot use?

In your own chat with a teammate's Team Bot, the Bot usually works on your Grok Bot computer. That means it can use the files there and the sites you're signed in to there. Sometimes it uses a separate computer just for that conversation, for example when your privacy mode is stricter than the owner's.

When you DM a Team Bot in Slack, it also works on your own computer. In Slack channels, threads, group DMs, and group chats, a Team Bot uses one shared computer of its own.

## Whose usage pays for a Team Bot chat?

A Team Bot reply uses the Grok Bot usage of the person it's answering. That's true in your own chat, in Slack, and in group chats. Your own limits apply. The owner's usage pays for the owner's own messages, and for Slack posts from apps or workflows that aren't linked to a Cursor account. A reply to someone in Slack who hasn't linked an account or isn't on the team uses the team's usage. See [Plans and billing](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/plans.md).

## How do approvals work on a Team Bot?

A Team Bot asks the person it's answering before risky actions.

- In your own chat with a Team Bot, you answer its approval cards.
- In a Slack thread, the Bot posts a **Review an action** card with **Allow once**, **Deny**, and **View details**. Only the person who asked can answer it.
- In a group chat, only the person whose message the Bot is answering can answer.

It also asks before it uses your personal accounts. See [Whose apps and secrets does a Team Bot use?](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/team-bots.md#whose-apps-and-secrets-does-a-team-bot-use)

## How do I add a Team Bot to Slack?

The owner or a Manager adds it, after sharing:

1. Click the Bot's name at the top of the chat.
2. Find **Bring to your team's Slack** and choose **Connect**.
3. If it says **Awaiting admin approval**, a Slack workspace admin needs to approve the app.

Once it says **Connected**, teammates can message the Bot directly or mention it in channels.

In a channel thread or a DM, the Team Bot acts for the teammate who mentioned it. It can hand work to that person's own Bots, and their replies are posted back into the same thread. A personal Bot doesn't hand work to other Bots from a channel thread. See [Can a Bot message other Bots from Slack?](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/group-chats.md#can-a-bot-message-other-bots-from-slack)

Bots record who asked for each message they post in Slack, so anyone in the thread can ask the Bot who requested it. When a Team Bot's routine replies in a Slack thread, the Bot follows that thread and answers later replies without an @mention.

Teammates link their own Slack accounts the first time they message the Bot. See [How do I chat with a Team Bot in Slack?](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/team-bots.md#how-do-i-chat-with-a-team-bot-in-slack)

## How do I chat with a Team Bot in Slack?

Mention the Bot in a channel, or send it a direct message. A Bot needs to know which Cursor account you are before it can chat with you, so the first time, it asks you to connect.

1. Choose **Connect**. Your browser opens cursor.com.
2. Sign in with the Cursor account that matches the Bot's team, then choose **Link Account**. If you're already signed in, you go straight to that page.
3. Choose **Open Slack** to return to Slack. The Bot answers the message you sent if you successfully linked your Cursor account on the Bot's team.

You connect once per Slack workspace. The link covers every Bot in that workspace, and Cloud Agents you start from Slack.

You can also link before a Bot asks:

- On desktop, open **Settings** > **General** > **Team Bots** and choose **Link**.
- In the Cursor dashboard, open [Integrations](https://cursor.com/dashboard/integrations?view=slack-management) and choose Slack.
  - If your workspace is listed under **Workspaces** and isn't marked **Connection expired**, you're linked.
  - If your workspace is marked **Connection expired**, choose **Reconnect**, then pick your workspace in Slack's dialog and allow it.
  - If other workspaces are listed but yours isn't, choose **Add to another workspace**, then pick your workspace in Slack's dialog and allow it.
  - If it says **No Slack workspaces linked**, choose **Install Cursor in Slack**, then pick your workspace in Slack's dialog and allow it.

Once you're connected, the Bot can still decline if it isn't shared with you. See [Who can talk to a Team Bot in Slack?](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/team-bots.md#who-can-talk-to-a-team-bot-in-slack)

## Who can talk to a Team Bot in Slack?

It depends on who the Bot is shared with.

- **Your organization**: any full member of your Slack workspace can mention it in channels and threads, even without a linked Cursor account or a seat on your team. Without a linked account, they're told once per thread that **some features will be limited**. In a DM, they still need to connect first. The same goes for a Bot shared with your team when the team isn't in an organization, or is the only team in it.
- **Your team, or certain people**: only people it's shared with. A linked teammate without access is told the Bot **hasn't been shared with you yet**. Add them under **Share this Bot**. Someone without a linked account is asked to connect one. See [How do I chat with a Team Bot in Slack?](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/team-bots.md#how-do-i-chat-with-a-team-bot-in-slack)
- **A personal Bot** only chats with its owner.

Slack guests, Slack Connect channels, and other Slack workspaces are never included. If your Slack email matches a Cursor account that already has access, the Bot asks you to link it instead.

A team admin can turn this off for workspace members who aren't on the team. See [How do admins manage Team Bots?](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/team-bots.md#how-do-admins-manage-team-bots)

## How do I edit or delete a Team Bot?

The owner and the Bot's Managers can change a Team Bot. Click the Bot's name at the top of the chat to open its details, or choose the wrench at the top right to open **Bot settings**:

- **Plugins** (the Bot's connected apps), **Secrets**, **Skills**, and **Files** hold what the Bot uses for everyone.
- Click the name to rename the Bot. Edit the description under **About**.
- **Share** controls who can use the Bot and who manages it.

The owner can also rename the Bot by right-clicking it in the sidebar and choosing **Rename Bot**.

Only the owner can delete a Team Bot. Right-click the Bot in the sidebar and choose **Delete**. A team admin can also delete it from **Manage Bots** in the Cursor dashboard. This deletes the Bot for your whole team. Teammates lose it, along with their chats and routines on it. It can't be undone.

## How do I remove a Team Bot from my sidebar?

Right-click the Bot and choose **Hide from sidebar**. To add it back, choose **+** in the sidebar, then **Browse shared Bots**, and choose **Add** next to it.

If your admin added the Bot to your sidebar for you, **Hide from sidebar** isn't in its menu, and you can't remove it.

## Can I use Team Bots on my phone?

Yes. Team Bots you've added appear in the phone app. To find another, tap **+**, then **Browse shared Bots**. You can chat with Team Bots and answer their **Allow** cards. A Team Bot can't be your primary Bot.

Sharing and browsing on the phone need Grok Bot 1.19.0 or later on iPhone and Android, from the App Store or Google Play. Earlier versions still open the Team Bots already in your list.

## Can I voice chat with a teammate's Team Bot?

Yes, on desktop. In your own chat with the Bot, choose **Start voice chat**. See [Voice chat with a Bot](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/voice-chat.md).

## Can a Team Bot join a group chat?

Yes. You can add a Bot a teammate shared with you to your own group chat. It can't share a group with Bots that run on your own computer. See [Group chats and Bot-to-Bot messages](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/group-chats.md).

## How do admins manage Team Bots?

On the Grok Bot page of the [Cursor dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard/bot), open **Manage Bots** under **Shared Bots**.

- **Access** shows who can use each Team Bot. Click it to change who can use the Bot.
- **Auto-add** puts the Bot in members' sidebars automatically. Pick **All team** or one or more groups. Those members can't hide it. Auto-add only applies to groups that have access.
- Admins can also delete a Team Bot here.

Under **Sharing** on the same page:

- **Bot sharing** decides who may share Bots: **Everyone** or **Admins only**. Bots already shared stay shared.
- **Allow Shared Logins** lets Managers share their own app logins as [shared connectors](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/team-bots.md#how-do-shared-connectors-work). Everyone who uses the Bot then acts through that Manager's account. It's off by default.
- **Slack Workspace Access** lets members of your Slack workspace who aren't on the team use Bots shared with your organization. It's on by default, and in an organization it applies to every team. The setting appears as it reaches your team.

See [Grok Bot for Teams and Enterprise](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/teams.md#manage-bots).
