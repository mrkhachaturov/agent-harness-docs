# Usage and limits

Each Cursor plan includes two monthly usage pools:

- **Cursor Models**: Cursor Grok 4.5 and Composer 2.5
- **Other Models**: Third-party models, charged at model provider prices

Higher-tier plans include more usage in both pools. See [Models & Pricing](https://cursor.com/docs/models-and-pricing.md) for plan details.

Your model selection affects how quickly your included usage is consumed.

Current usage-based plans don't include Max Mode. On legacy request-based plans, [Max Mode](https://cursor.com/help/ai-features/max-mode.md) is billed at the model's API rate plus 20%.

## How do I check my usage?

Go to the [Spending](https://cursor.com/dashboard/spending) tab in your dashboard. It shows real-time usage for both pools, remaining allowance, and any on-demand charges.

## What happens when I hit my usage limit?

You'll see a notification in the editor. You can either enable on-demand usage (pay-as-you-go) or upgrade to a higher plan.

## When does my usage reset?

Usage resets monthly with your billing cycle. Unused usage does not roll over. The reset date is shown on the [Spending](https://cursor.com/dashboard/spending) tab.

For teams, all members' usage resets at the same time based on the team billing cycle.

## How do I get more usage?

- **Use Cursor Models**: Cursor Grok 4.5 and Composer 2.5 draw from the Cursor Models pool, tracked separately and included with your plan
- **Enable on-demand usage**: Pay for additional requests at the same API rates
- **[Upgrade your plan](https://cursor.com/help/account-and-billing/pricing.md#how-do-i-upgrade-my-plan)**: Higher-tier plans include more usage

## How does Cursor Router interact with my plan's usage pools and limits?

Cursor Router requests are billed at the routed model's cost and can draw from both the First-party models pool and the API (third-party) pool, depending on which model handles the request.

- **Composer 2.5** requests carry no [Cursor Token Rate](https://cursor.com/help/models-and-usage/token-rate.md) on any plan
- **Cost** mode (legacy Auto) keeps bundled Auto pricing
- **Balance** and **Intelligence** bill at the selected model's rate under your plan

When included usage runs out, on-demand charges apply if you have on-demand usage enabled. Check your [usage dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard/usage) for request-level cost and pool details.

See [Cursor Router](https://cursor.com/help/models-and-usage/cursor-router.md) for mode details.
