# Cursor TypeScript SDK

The `@cursor/sdk` package lets you call Cursor's agent from your own code. The same agent that runs in the Cursor IDE, CLI, and web app is now scriptable from TypeScript. Run the `/sdk` skill inside Cursor to get started.

### Cookbook

End-to-end examples live in the [Cursor
Cookbook](https://github.com/cursor/cookbook): a [SDK
quickstart](https://github.com/cursor/cookbook/tree/main/sdk/quickstart), an
[app-builder prototyping
tool](https://github.com/cursor/cookbook/tree/main/sdk/app-builder), a [kanban
board for cloud
agents](https://github.com/cursor/cookbook/tree/main/sdk/agent-kanban), and a
[coding-agent
CLI](https://github.com/cursor/cookbook/tree/main/sdk/coding-agent-cli). Good
starting points for CI auto-fix bots, bug triage workers, code-review passes,
embedded in-product agents, and orchestrators.

## Overview

The SDK wraps local and cloud runtimes behind one interface. You write the same code regardless of where the agent runs.

| Runtime                   | What it does                                                                                                       | When to use                                                                                                                |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local**                 | Runs the agent loop inline in your Node process. Files come from disk.                                             | Dev scripts and CI checks against a working tree.                                                                          |
| **Cloud (Cursor-hosted)** | Runs in an isolated VM with your repo cloned in. Cursor runs the VMs.                                              | When the caller doesn't have the repo, you want many agents in parallel, or runs need to survive the caller disconnecting. |
| **Cloud (self-hosted)**   | Same shape, but you run the VMs via a [self-hosted pool](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/self-hosted-pool.md). | Same reasons as Cursor-hosted, plus code, secrets, and build artifacts must stay in your environment.                      |

### Local means local agent loop, not local model

"Local" describes where the agent loop and filesystem access run, not where
the model runs. All inference goes through Cursor's hosted models in both
modes. Local mode keeps your files on your machine; cloud mode runs in a
Cursor environment. The model itself is hosted in either case.

Runtime is picked by which key you pass to `Agent.create()` (`local` or `cloud`). Use the same `CURSOR_API_KEY` for either.

For the REST API, see the [Cloud Agents API](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/api/endpoints.md).

## Authentication

Set `CURSOR_API_KEY` (or pass `apiKey`) before creating an agent.

The SDK accepts user API keys and service account API keys for both local and cloud runs. Team Admin API keys are not yet supported.

- **User API key** from [Cursor Dashboard → API Keys](https://cursor.com/dashboard/api)
- **Service account API key** from [Team settings](https://cursor.com/dashboard/team-settings). See [Service accounts](https://cursor.com/docs/account/enterprise/service-accounts.md)

```bash
export CURSOR_API_KEY="your-key"
```

## Usage and billing

SDK runs follow the same pricing, request pools, and Privacy Mode rules as runs from the IDE and Cloud Agents. Spend shows up in your team's [usage dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard/usage) under the SDK tag.

Service account API keys bill to the team that owns the service account. User API keys bill to that user's plan.

## Core concepts

| Concept        | Description                                                                                                        |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent**      | Durable container that holds conversation state, workspace config, and settings. Survives across multiple prompts. |
| **Run**        | One prompt submission. Owns its own stream, status, result, and cancellation.                                      |
| **SDKMessage** | Normalized stream events emitted during a run. Same shape across all runtimes.                                     |

## Installation

```bash
npm install @cursor/sdk
```

The package name starts with `@`. The bare `cursor/sdk` doesn't exist on npm.

### Runtime support

The SDK requires Node.js 22.13 or later. It ships per-platform `@cursor/sdk-<os>-<arch>` binaries for sandboxing and ripgrep, so it is a Node-first package.

Importing `@cursor/sdk` does not eagerly load the local agent stack. The local executor loads on the first local `acquire`, so cloud-only and type-only consumers don't pay the local import cost. The first local agent in a process pays a one-time import, then the module stays cached.

The current package, `@cursor/sdk@1.0.22`, publishes self-contained `.d.ts` files, so types resolve without pulling in unpublished workspace packages. After upgrading, re-run your typecheck. Stream types such as `TurnEndedUpdate` resolve to real types instead of `any`.

## Quick start

The fastest way in: a local agent against your current working tree, streaming events as they come in. Cloud setup is in [Creating agents](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript.md#creating-agents) below.

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@cursor/sdk";

const agent = await Agent.create({
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
  model: { id: "composer-2.5" },
  local: { cwd: process.cwd() },
});

const run = await agent.send("Summarize what this repository does");

for await (const event of run.stream()) {
  console.log(event);
}
```

Each event is a discriminated `SDKMessage`. [Streaming](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript.md#streaming) shows how to extract assistant text, handle tool calls, and clean up with `await using`. For a one-shot prompt (create, run, dispose), see [Agent.prompt()](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript.md#agentprompt).

### Quickstart approves tool calls automatically

The default local agent runs tool calls (shell, edit, write, etc.) without
asking for approval; there's no human-in-the-loop prompt in headless mode. To
gate tool calls, configure [hooks](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript.md#hooks) (such as `beforeShellExecution` or
`preToolUse`) or run with [`local.sandboxOptions.enabled:
  true`](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript.md#sandbox-options).

## Creating agents

```typescript
function Agent.create(options: AgentOptions): Promise<SDKAgent>;
```

`Agent.create()` validates options and returns a handle immediately. Pass either `local` or `cloud` to pick a runtime.

```typescript
// Local agent
const agent = await Agent.create({
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
  model: { id: "composer-2.5" },
  local: { cwd: "/path/to/repo" },
});

// Cloud agent
const agent = await Agent.create({
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
  model: { id: "composer-2.5" },
  cloud: {
    repos: [{ url: "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo", startingRef: "main" }],
    autoCreatePR: true,
  },
});
```

`agent.agentId` is populated immediately. Local agents get an `agent-<uuid>` ID; cloud agents get a `bc-<uuid>` ID.

Cloud agents started by the SDK are filtered out of the default agent list. To
view them in Cursor Web or a Cursor window, click **Filter > Source > SDK**.

### Session environment variables

For cloud agents, pass `cloud.envVars` when a run needs short-lived credentials or other values that should live only with that agent.

```typescript
const agent = await Agent.create({
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
  cloud: {
    repos: [{ url: "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo" }],
    envVars: {
      STAGING_API_TOKEN: process.env.STAGING_API_TOKEN!,
    },
  },
});
```

These values are encrypted at rest, injected into the cloud agent's shell, and deleted with the agent. `envVars` can't be used with a caller-supplied `agentId`; omit `agentId` and read the server-minted ID from `agent.agentId`. Variable names can't start with `CURSOR_`.

### Model parameters

Use `model.params` to pass per-model options such as reasoning effort. Parameter ids and values vary by model. Use [`Cursor.models.list()`](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript.md#cursormodelslist) to discover supported parameters and preset variants for your account.

When a selected model requires [Max Mode](https://cursor.com/help/ai-features/max-mode.md), Cursor enables it automatically for the SDK request.

### Composer 2 reroutes to Composer 2.5

Composer 2 is retired. SDK requests that still pass `composer-2` or
`composer-2-fast` are rerouted to Composer 2.5 at auth time, so existing
scripts keep working. If you relied on the `composer-2-fast` variant, confirm
the fast behavior still matches what you expect.

```typescript
const agent = await Agent.create({
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
  model: {
    id: "composer-2.5",
    params: [{ id: "fast", value: "true" }],
  },
  local: { cwd: process.cwd() },
});
```

### SDKAgent

The handle returned by `Agent.create()` and `Agent.resume()`.

```typescript
interface SDKAgent {
  readonly agentId: string;
  readonly model: ModelSelection | undefined;

  send(message: string | SDKUserMessage, options?: SendOptions): Promise<Run>;
  close(): void;
  reload(): Promise<void>;
  [Symbol.asyncDispose](): Promise<void>;

  listArtifacts(): Promise<SDKArtifact[]>;
  downloadArtifact(path: string): Promise<Buffer>;
}
```

| Member                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agentId`               | Stable agent identifier. `agent-<uuid>` for local, `bc-<uuid>` for cloud.                                                                                                    |
| `model`                 | Current model selection. Updates after every successful `send({ model })`. `undefined` until something sets it (including resumed agents whose caller did not pass `model`). |
| `send`                  | Start a new run with the given prompt. Returns a `Run` handle.                                                                                                               |
| `close`                 | Begin disposal without awaiting. Fire-and-forget.                                                                                                                            |
| `reload`                | Re-read filesystem config (hooks, project MCP, subagents) without disposing.                                                                                                 |
| `[Symbol.asyncDispose]` | Async disposal. Pair with `await using` for automatic cleanup.                                                                                                               |
| `listArtifacts`         | List files produced by the agent (cloud only; local returns empty).                                                                                                          |
| `downloadArtifact`      | Download a file by path (cloud only; local throws).                                                                                                                          |

### Agent.prompt()

```typescript
function Agent.prompt(message: string, options?: AgentOptions): Promise<RunResult>;
```

One-shot convenience: creates an agent, sends a single prompt, waits for the run to finish, and disposes.

```typescript
const result = await Agent.prompt("What does the auth middleware do?", {
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
  model: { id: "composer-2.5" },
  local: { cwd: process.cwd() },
});
```

## Sending messages

Each `agent.send()` returns a `Run`. The agent retains conversation context across runs; the run is the unit of work for one prompt.

### Run

```typescript
type RunStatus = "running" | "finished" | "error" | "cancelled";
type RunOperation = "stream" | "wait" | "cancel" | "conversation";

interface Run {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly requestId?: string;
  readonly agentId: string;
  readonly status: RunStatus;
  readonly result?: string;
  readonly model?: ModelSelection;
  readonly durationMs?: number;
  readonly usage?: TokenUsage;
  readonly git?: RunGitInfo;
  readonly createdAt?: number;

  stream(): AsyncGenerator<SDKMessage, void>;
  wait(): Promise<RunResult>;
  cancel(): Promise<void>;
  conversation(): Promise<ConversationTurn[]>;

  supports(operation: RunOperation): boolean;
  unsupportedReason(operation: RunOperation): string | undefined;
  onDidChangeStatus(listener: (status: RunStatus) => void): () => void;
}

interface RunGitInfo {
  branches: Array<{ repoUrl: string; branch?: string; prUrl?: string }>;
}

interface TokenUsage {
  inputTokens: number;
  outputTokens: number;
  cacheReadTokens: number;
  cacheWriteTokens: number;
  totalTokens: number;
  reasoningTokens?: number;
}

interface RunResult {
  id: string;
  requestId?: string;
  status: "finished" | "error" | "cancelled";
  result?: string;
  model?: ModelSelection;
  durationMs?: number;
  git?: RunGitInfo;
  usage?: TokenUsage;
}
```

### Streaming

```typescript
const run = await agent.send("Find the bug in src/auth.ts");

for await (const event of run.stream()) {
  switch (event.type) {
    case "assistant":
      for (const block of event.message.content) {
        if (block.type === "text") process.stdout.write(block.text);
      }
      break;
    case "thinking":
      process.stdout.write(event.text);
      break;
    case "tool_call":
      console.log(`[tool] ${event.name}: ${event.status}`);
      break;
    case "status":
      console.log(`[status] ${event.status}`);
      break;
  }
}

// Follow-up on the same agent. Conversation state from the previous
// run is loaded automatically.
const run2 = await agent.send("Fix it and add a regression test");
await run2.wait();
```

To send images alongside text:

```typescript
const run = await agent.send({
  text: "What's in this screenshot?",
  images: [{ data: base64Png, mimeType: "image/png" }],
});
```

### Waiting without streaming

```typescript
const result = await run.wait();

console.log(result.status);      // "finished" | "error" | "cancelled"
console.log(result.result);      // final assistant text, if any
console.log(result.model);       // resolved ModelSelection used for this run
console.log(result.durationMs);
console.log(result.usage);       // cumulative token usage, if reported
console.log(result.git);         // { branches: [{ repoUrl, branch?, prUrl? }] } on cloud
```

The final assistant text is on `result.result` as a string. There's no `text`, `message`, `messages`, or `content` field to dig through. If you need the per-step transcript instead, call `run.conversation()` for a structured `ConversationTurn[]` view:

```typescript
const result = await run.wait();
const finalText = result.result ?? "";

const turns = await run.conversation();
const lastAssistant = turns
  .flatMap((t) => (t.type === "agentConversationTurn" ? t.turn.steps : []))
  .filter((s) => s.type === "assistantMessage")
  .at(-1);

console.log(lastAssistant?.message.text);
```

### Cancelling a run

```typescript
await run.cancel();
```

Cancels the run. The status moves to `"cancelled"`, the live stream aborts, in-flight tool calls stop, and `run.wait()` resolves with `status: "cancelled"`. Partial output (assistant text written so far) stays on the Run object.

Cancel is supported on running local and cloud runs and is a no-op if the run already finished.

### Reading run state

```typescript
console.log(run.status);  // "running" | "finished" | "error" | "cancelled"

const stop = run.onDidChangeStatus((status) => {
  console.log(`status changed to ${status}`);
});
// Call `stop()` to remove the listener.

// Structured per-turn view of the conversation accumulated in this run
const turns = await run.conversation();
```

`run.conversation()` returns the run's `ConversationTurn[]` (an agent turn with steps, or a shell turn with command and output). Use it to render or persist the run's structured history without subscribing to the live stream.

### Run correlation with requestId

Every `agent.send()` gets a platform-generated UUID, exposed as `requestId` on both the `Run` and the `RunResult`. Use it to tie a script or CI run to backend logs, analytics, and support threads instead of guessing from `agentId` alone.

```typescript
const run = await agent.send("Audit the auth middleware");
console.log(run.requestId); // e.g. "6e0d261c-86a2-4383-89f0-9162c1c10662"

const result = await run.wait();
logger.info({ requestId: result.requestId }, "run finished");
```

`requestId` persists with the run, so it round-trips through the in-memory, SQLite, and JSONL [local stores](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript.md#local-agent-stores) and is set on cloud runs when the backend returns one. Log it alongside `error.requestId` from [errors](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript.md#errors) so a single identifier spans both success and failure paths.

### Per-run model override

The `model` you pass to `agent.send()` overrides the agent's selection for that run, then becomes sticky: subsequent sends without an override continue to use the new model. To switch back, pass another `model` override or read the current selection from `agent.model`.

```typescript
const run = await agent.send("Plan the refactor", {
  model: { id: "composer-2.5", params: [{ id: "fast", value: "true" }] },
});

console.log(agent.model);  // updated to the override after the send succeeds
```

`run.model` and `result.model` reflect the selection that this specific run actually used and are immutable once the run starts.

### Conversation mode

Pass `mode: "plan"` or `mode: "agent"` to control whether a run explores and plans first or implements changes directly. See [Plan mode](https://cursor.com/help/ai-features/plan-mode.md) for what plan mode does in the product.

Set `mode` on `Agent.create()` to seed the first run. On follow-up `agent.send()` calls, omit `mode` to keep the conversation's current mode, or pass `mode` to switch for that run only.

```typescript
const agent = await Agent.create({
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
  model: { id: "composer-2.5" },
  mode: "plan",
  cloud: {
    repos: [{ url: "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo" }],
  },
});

await (await agent.send("Design the auth refactor")).wait();
await (await agent.send("Looks good, start building", { mode: "agent" })).wait();
```

### Streaming raw deltas

`run.stream()` yields normalized `SDKMessage` events. For lower-level updates (per-token text, tool-call args streaming in, thinking deltas, step boundaries), pass `onDelta` and `onStep` callbacks to `send()`:

```typescript
const run = await agent.send("Refactor the utils module", {
  onDelta: ({ update }) => {
    if (update.type === "text-delta") process.stdout.write(update.text);
    if (update.type === "thinking-delta") process.stdout.write(update.text);
  },
  onStep: ({ step }) => {
    console.log(`[step] ${step.type}`);
  },
});
```

The callbacks are awaited before the next update is processed, so you can apply backpressure. `InteractionUpdate` covers `text-delta`, `thinking-delta`, `thinking-completed`, `tool-call-started`, `tool-call-completed`, `partial-tool-call`, `token-delta`, `step-started`, `step-completed`, `turn-ended`, and a handful of summary and shell-output deltas.

### Per-send options

| Property            | Type                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `model`             | `ModelSelection`                              | Per-send model override. If omitted, uses `agent.model`. Sticky: a successful send updates `agent.model`.                                                                    |
| `mode`              | `"agent" \| "plan"`                           | Per-send conversation mode override. If omitted on follow-ups, keeps the conversation's current mode.                                                                        |
| `mcpServers`        | `Record<string, McpServerConfig>`             | Inline MCP server definitions. Fully replaces creation-time servers for this run.                                                                                            |
| `onStep`            | `(args: { step }) => void \| Promise<void>`   | Callback after each completed conversation step (text, thinking, or tool batch).                                                                                             |
| `onDelta`           | `(args: { update }) => void \| Promise<void>` | Callback per raw `InteractionUpdate`.                                                                                                                                        |

## Stream events

Events from `run.stream()`. Discriminate on `type`. All events include `agent_id` and `run_id`.

```typescript
type SDKMessage =
  | SDKSystemMessage
  | SDKUserMessageEvent
  | SDKAssistantMessage
  | SDKThinkingMessage
  | SDKToolUseMessage
  | SDKStatusMessage
  | SDKTaskMessage
  | SDKRequestMessage
  | SDKUsageMessage;
```

| `type`        | Description                                                                                      | Key fields                                                    |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `"system"`    | Init metadata. Emitted once at the start of a run.                                               | `subtype?` (`"init"`), `model?`, `tools?`                     |
| `"user"`      | Echo of the user prompt for this run.                                                            | `message.content: TextBlock[]`                                |
| `"assistant"` | Model text output.                                                                               | `message.content: (TextBlock \| ToolUseBlock)[]`              |
| `"thinking"`  | Reasoning content.                                                                               | `text`, `thinking_duration_ms?`                               |
| `"tool_call"` | Tool invocation lifecycle. Emitted at start with `args`, then again on completion with `result`. | `call_id`, `name`, `status`, `args?`, `result?`, `truncated?` |
| `"status"`    | Cloud run lifecycle transitions.                                                                 | `status`, `message?`                                          |
| `"task"`      | Task-level milestones and summaries.                                                             | `status?`, `text?`                                            |
| `"request"`   | Awaiting user input or approval.                                                                 | `request_id`                                                  |
| `"usage"`     | Per-turn token usage when the runtime reports it.                                                | `usage`                                                       |

Result data (final text, model, duration, usage, and git metadata) lives on the `Run` object after the stream completes. Use `run.wait()` to read it.

> **Tool call schema is not stable.** The `args` and `result` payloads on `tool_call` events reflect each tool's internal shape and can change as tools evolve. Tool names can also be renamed or replaced. Treat `args` and `result` as `unknown` and parse defensively. The event envelope (`type`, `call_id`, `name`, `status`) is stable.

### Message types

```typescript
interface SDKSystemMessage {
  type: "system";
  subtype?: "init";
  agent_id: string;
  run_id: string;
  model?: ModelSelection;
  tools?: string[];
}

interface SDKUserMessageEvent {
  type: "user";
  agent_id: string;
  run_id: string;
  message: { role: "user"; content: TextBlock[] };
}

interface SDKAssistantMessage {
  type: "assistant";
  agent_id: string;
  run_id: string;
  message: {
    role: "assistant";
    content: Array<TextBlock | ToolUseBlock>;
  };
}

interface SDKThinkingMessage {
  type: "thinking";
  agent_id: string;
  run_id: string;
  text: string;
  thinking_duration_ms?: number;
}

interface SDKToolUseMessage {
  type: "tool_call";
  agent_id: string;
  run_id: string;
  call_id: string;
  name: string;
  status: "running" | "completed" | "error";
  args?: unknown;
  result?: unknown;
  truncated?: { args?: boolean; result?: boolean };
}

interface SDKStatusMessage {
  type: "status";
  agent_id: string;
  run_id: string;
  status: "CREATING" | "RUNNING" | "FINISHED" | "ERROR" | "CANCELLED" | "EXPIRED";
  message?: string;
}

interface SDKTaskMessage {
  type: "task";
  agent_id: string;
  run_id: string;
  status?: string;
  text?: string;
}

interface SDKRequestMessage {
  type: "request";
  agent_id: string;
  run_id: string;
  request_id: string;
}

interface SDKUsageMessage {
  type: "usage";
  agent_id: string;
  run_id: string;
  usage: TokenUsage;
}

interface TextBlock {
  type: "text";
  text: string;
}

interface ToolUseBlock {
  type: "tool_use";
  id: string;
  name: string;
  input: unknown;
}
```

`SDKToolUseMessage` is emitted twice for most tool calls: first with `status: "running"` and `args` populated, then again on completion with `status: "completed"` (or `"error"`) and `result` populated. `truncated` flags whether the SDK truncated `args` or `result` because the payload was too large.

`SDKStatusMessage` covers cloud-side lifecycle transitions. `CREATING` covers VM provisioning and repo cloning; `RUNNING` is the agent doing work; the rest are terminal.

## Interaction updates

`InteractionUpdate` is the raw delta type passed to the `onDelta` callback on `agent.send()`. Updates are finer-grained than `SDKMessage` events: text streams in token-by-token, tool calls report partial state as args accumulate, thinking arrives as it happens.

```typescript
type InteractionUpdate =
  | TextDeltaUpdate
  | ThinkingDeltaUpdate
  | ThinkingCompletedUpdate
  | ToolCallStartedUpdate
  | ToolCallCompletedUpdate
  | PartialToolCallUpdate
  | TokenDeltaUpdate
  | StepStartedUpdate
  | StepCompletedUpdate
  | TurnEndedUpdate
  | UserMessageAppendedUpdate
  | SummaryUpdate
  | SummaryStartedUpdate
  | SummaryCompletedUpdate
  | ShellOutputDeltaUpdate;
```

### Update types

```typescript
interface TextDeltaUpdate {
  type: "text-delta";
  text: string;
}

interface ThinkingDeltaUpdate {
  type: "thinking-delta";
  text: string;
}

interface ThinkingCompletedUpdate {
  type: "thinking-completed";
  thinkingDurationMs: number;
}

interface ToolCallStartedUpdate {
  type: "tool-call-started";
  callId: string;
  toolCall: ToolCall;
  modelCallId: string;
}

interface PartialToolCallUpdate {
  type: "partial-tool-call";
  callId: string;
  toolCall: ToolCall;
  modelCallId: string;
}

interface ToolCallCompletedUpdate {
  type: "tool-call-completed";
  callId: string;
  toolCall: ToolCall;
  modelCallId: string;
}

interface TokenDeltaUpdate {
  type: "token-delta";
  tokens: number;
}

interface StepStartedUpdate {
  type: "step-started";
  stepId: number;
}

interface StepCompletedUpdate {
  type: "step-completed";
  stepId: number;
  stepDurationMs: number;
}

interface TurnEndedUpdate {
  type: "turn-ended";
  usage?: {
    inputTokens: number;
    outputTokens: number;
    cacheReadTokens: number;
    cacheWriteTokens: number;
    reasoningTokens?: number;
  };
}

interface UserMessageAppendedUpdate {
  type: "user-message-appended";
  userMessage: UserMessage;
}

interface SummaryUpdate {
  type: "summary";
  summary: string;
}

interface SummaryStartedUpdate {
  type: "summary-started";
}

interface SummaryCompletedUpdate {
  type: "summary-completed";
}

interface ShellOutputDeltaUpdate {
  type: "shell-output-delta";
  event: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

`PartialToolCallUpdate` is emitted as the model streams arguments into a tool call before it commits. The same stability disclaimer that applies to `SDKToolUseMessage.args` applies here.

## Conversation types

The structured per-turn view of a run, returned by `run.conversation()` and used in the `onStep` callback's argument.

```typescript
type ConversationTurn =
  | { type: "agentConversationTurn"; turn: AgentConversationTurn }
  | { type: "shellConversationTurn"; turn: ShellConversationTurn };

interface AgentConversationTurn {
  userMessage?: UserMessage;
  steps: ConversationStep[];
}

interface ShellConversationTurn {
  shellCommand?: ShellCommand;
  shellOutput?: ShellOutput;
}

type ConversationStep =
  | { type: "assistantMessage"; message: AssistantMessage }
  | { type: "toolCall"; message: ToolCall }
  | { type: "thinkingMessage"; message: ThinkingMessage };

interface AssistantMessage {
  text: string;
}

interface ThinkingMessage {
  text: string;
  thinkingDurationMs?: number;
}

interface UserMessage {
  text: string;
}

interface ShellCommand {
  command: string;
  workingDirectory?: string;
}

interface ShellOutput {
  stdout: string;
  stderr: string;
  exitCode: number;
}
```

`ToolCall` is a discriminated union over every built-in tool (shell, edit, read, write, glob, grep, ls, semSearch, mcp, task, and others). Its shape is internal-facing; see the [stability note](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript.md#stream-events) under Stream events.

## Resuming agents

```typescript
function Agent.resume(agentId: string, options?: Partial<AgentOptions>): Promise<SDKAgent>;
```

Use `Agent.resume()` to reattach to an existing agent by ID. Common flows: reconnecting to a long-running cloud agent that was kicked off earlier, or continuing a conversation after the local process restarted. Runtime is auto-detected from the ID prefix (`bc-` is cloud, anything else is local).

```typescript
await using agent = await Agent.resume("bc-abc123", {
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
});

const run = await agent.send("Also update the changelog");
await run.wait();
```

`agent.model` is `undefined` on resume unless you pass `model` again. Inline `mcpServers` are not persisted across resume — they often carry secrets and live in memory only. Pass them again on resume, or use file-based MCP config (`.cursor/mcp.json` + `local.settingSources`) for servers that should survive.

## Inspecting agents and runs

List, fetch, and reload past agents. List endpoints return `{ items, nextCursor? }` for cursor-based pagination.

### Agent.list()

```typescript
function Agent.list(options?: ListAgentsOptions): Promise<ListResult<SDKAgentInfo>>;

type ListAgentsOptions = {
  limit?: number;
  cursor?: string;
} & (
  | { runtime?: undefined }
  | { runtime: "local"; cwd?: string; store?: LocalAgentStore }
  | {
      runtime: "cloud";
      prUrl?: string;
      includeArchived?: boolean;
      apiKey?: string;
    }
);
```

```typescript
const { items, nextCursor } = await Agent.list({
  runtime: "local",
  cwd: process.cwd(),
});
```

### Agent.get()

```typescript
function Agent.get(agentId: string, options?: GetAgentOptions): Promise<SDKAgentInfo>;

interface GetAgentOptions {
  cwd?: string;       // local routing
  apiKey?: string;    // cloud routing
  store?: LocalAgentStore;
}
```

Runtime is auto-detected from the agent ID prefix (`bc-` → cloud, otherwise local).

### Agent.listRuns()

```typescript
function Agent.listRuns(agentId: string, options?: ListRunsOptions): Promise<ListResult<Run>>;

type ListRunsOptions = {
  limit?: number;
  cursor?: string;
} & (
  | { runtime?: "local"; cwd?: string; store?: LocalAgentStore }
  | { runtime: "cloud"; apiKey?: string }
);
```

### Agent.getRun()

```typescript
function Agent.getRun(runId: string, options?: GetRunOptions): Promise<Run>;

type GetRunOptions =
  | { runtime?: "local"; cwd?: string; store?: LocalAgentStore }
  | { runtime: "cloud"; agentId: string; apiKey?: string };
```

Cloud `getRun` requires the parent `agentId`.

### Agent.cancelRun()

```typescript
function Agent.cancelRun(runId: string, options?: GetRunOptions): Promise<void>;
```

Cancels a run when you have its ID but do not have a `Run` handle.

### Agent.messages.list()

```typescript
Agent.messages.list(
  agentId: string,
  options?: GetAgentMessagesOptions
): Promise<AgentMessage[]>;

interface GetAgentMessagesOptions {
  limit?: number;
  offset?: number;
  runtime?: "local";
  cwd?: string;
  store?: LocalAgentStore;
}
```

Returns the stored user and assistant messages for a local agent.

### Cloud agent lifecycle

Cloud agents stay in your team's workspace until you archive or delete them. `Agent.list({ runtime: "cloud" })` hides archived agents by default; pass `includeArchived: true` to see them. Filter by `prUrl` to find the agent that opened a specific pull request.

```typescript
function Agent.archive(agentId: string, options?: AgentOperationOptions): Promise<void>;
function Agent.unarchive(agentId: string, options?: AgentOperationOptions): Promise<void>;
function Agent.delete(agentId: string, options?: AgentOperationOptions): Promise<void>;

interface AgentOperationOptions {
  cwd?: string;
  apiKey?: string;
  store?: LocalAgentStore;
}
```

```typescript
await Agent.archive(agentId);     // soft-delete; transcript stays readable
await Agent.unarchive(agentId);   // restore an archived agent
await Agent.delete(agentId);      // permanent; subsequent reads return 404
```

### SDKAgentInfo

The metadata shape returned by `Agent.list()` and `Agent.get()`.

```typescript
type SDKAgentInfo = {
  agentId: string;
  name: string;
  summary: string;
  lastModified: number;
  status?: "running" | "finished" | "error";
  createdAt?: number;
  archived?: boolean;
} & (
  | { runtime?: undefined }
  | { runtime: "local"; cwd?: string }
  | {
      runtime: "cloud";
      env?: { type: "cloud" | "pool" | "machine"; name?: string };
      repos?: string[];
    }
);
```

## The Cursor namespace

Account-level reads, catalog reads, and process-wide SDK configuration. The read methods take an optional `{ apiKey }` and otherwise fall back to `CURSOR_API_KEY`.

### Cursor.configure()

```typescript
function Cursor.configure(options: CursorConfigureOptions): void;

interface CursorConfigureOptions {
  local?: {
    store?: LocalAgentStore | null;
    useHttp1ForAgent?: boolean | null;
  };
}
```

Set defaults for local agents that apply to later `Agent.*` calls. Fields on an individual call override these values; pass `null` to clear a previous default.

| Option                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `local.store`            | Default [local agent store](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript.md#local-agent-stores) when a call omits `local.store`. The SDK uses on-disk SQLite through Node's `node:sqlite`. Use `JsonlLocalAgentStore` or another store when you want to avoid SQLite storage. |
| `local.useHttp1ForAgent` | Force local agent backend streams to use HTTP/1.1 with SSE instead of HTTP/2. Useful behind proxies or on fetch stacks that don't support HTTP/2.                                                                                                                       |

```typescript
import { Cursor, JsonlLocalAgentStore } from "@cursor/sdk";

Cursor.configure({
  local: {
    store: new JsonlLocalAgentStore("/var/lib/cursor-agents"),
    useHttp1ForAgent: true,
  },
});
```

### Cursor.me()

```typescript
function Cursor.me(options?: CursorRequestOptions): Promise<SDKUser>;

interface CursorRequestOptions {
  apiKey?: string;
}

interface SDKUser {
  apiKeyName: string;
  userId?: number;
  userEmail?: string;
  userFirstName?: string;
  userLastName?: string;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### Cursor.models.list()

```typescript
function Cursor.models.list(options?: CursorRequestOptions): Promise<SDKModel[]>;

type SDKModel = ModelListItem;

interface ModelListItem {
  id: string;
  displayName: string;
  description?: string;
  aliases?: string[];
  parameters?: ModelParameterDefinition[];
  variants?: ModelVariant[];
}

interface ModelParameterDefinition {
  id: string;
  displayName?: string;
  values: Array<{ value: string; displayName?: string }>;
}

interface ModelVariant {
  params: ModelParameterValue[];
  displayName: string;
  description?: string;
  isDefault?: boolean;
}
```

Use `Cursor.models.list()` to discover valid `model` ids and per-model `params` before calling `Agent.create()` or `agent.send()`. Parameters are model-specific. Common examples include reasoning effort.

```typescript
const models = await Cursor.models.list();
const composer = models.find((model) => model.id === "composer-2.5");

console.log(composer?.parameters);
// [
//   {
//     id: "fast",
//     displayName: "Fast",
//     values: [
//       { value: "false" },
//       { value: "true", displayName: "Fast" },
//     ],
//   },
// ]
```

Pass selected parameter values through `model.params`. Preset `variants` already contain valid `params`, so you can copy them into a model selection.

```typescript
const agent = await Agent.create({
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
  model: {
    id: "composer-2.5",
    params: [{ id: "fast", value: "true" }],
  },
  local: { cwd: process.cwd() },
});
```

#### Best practices

- **Discover, don't hard-code.** Call `Cursor.models.list()` at startup (or once per process) and cache the result. Model ids and parameter shapes can change as new models ship.
- **Pass parameters explicitly when the model expects them.** A model whose `parameters` array is non-empty is a parameterized model. Send the params you want; otherwise the run uses each parameter's first allowed value, which may not match what you intend.
- **Resolve by capability, not id.** If you want "the current default in fast mode" rather than a specific model, look it up:

  ```typescript
  const models = await Cursor.models.list();
  const composer = models.find((m) => m.id === "composer-2.5");
  const fast = composer?.parameters?.find((p) => p.id === "fast");
  const fastValue = fast?.values.find((v) => v.value === "true")?.value;

  const model = composer
    ? {
        id: composer.id,
        params: fastValue ? [{ id: "fast", value: fastValue }] : undefined,
      }
    : { id: "auto" };
  ```

  Falling back to `{ id: "auto" }` when a target model isn't available keeps scripts working as the catalog evolves.

### Cursor.repositories.list()

```typescript
function Cursor.repositories.list(options?: CursorRequestOptions): Promise<SDKRepository[]>;

interface SDKRepository {
  url: string;
}
```

Returns the GitHub repositories connected for the calling user's team. Cloud only.

## Configuration sources at a glance

MCP servers, subagents, and hooks all resolve from a mix of inline options and on-disk config. The precedence is the same shape across the three: per-send inline > creation-time inline > project files > user files > team / dashboard config.

| Feature              | Inline option                                               | Local file (project)                                                       | Local file (user)                        | Cloud / dashboard                                                                      | Precedence                                                                                              |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **MCP servers**      | `mcpServers` on `Agent.create()` and `agent.send()`         | `.cursor/mcp.json` (gated by `local.settingSources` including `"project"`) | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (gated by `"user"`) | Servers configured at [cursor.com/agents](https://cursor.com/agents) (cloud only)      | Send > create > plugins > project > user (local); Send > create > dashboard (cloud)                     |

Inline values are good for secrets that should never touch disk (per-run API keys, tenant-scoped tokens). File-based config is good for policy: hooks especially are a project boundary, not a per-run knob.

## MCP servers

Agents can pick up MCP servers from several sources. Inline definitions in `Agent.create()` or `agent.send()` are the most common path. File-based and dashboard-managed configs are also supported.

### What gets loaded

**Local agents** load servers from up to five sources, with first-match-wins precedence on conflicting names:

1. `mcpServers` on `agent.send()`. Fully replaces creation-time servers for that run (not merged).
2. `mcpServers` on `Agent.create()`. Used when no per-send override is provided.
3. Plugin servers, if `local.settingSources` includes `"plugins"`.
4. Project servers from `.cursor/mcp.json`, if `local.settingSources` includes `"project"`.
5. User servers from `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, if `local.settingSources` includes `"user"`.

Without `local.settingSources`, only inline servers are loaded. If a local MCP server requires OAuth login, the SDK can't prompt you to sign in. It only works if you've already signed in to that server from the Cursor app, in which case the SDK reuses that saved login.

**Cloud agents** load servers from:

1. `mcpServers` on `agent.send()`. Fully replaces creation-time servers for that run (not merged).
2. `mcpServers` on `Agent.create()`. Used when no per-send override is provided.
3. Your user and team MCP servers from [cursor.com/agents](https://cursor.com/agents).

If an inline server doesn't include `auth` or `headers` and you've previously authorized that server URL on cursor.com/agents, runs authenticated with a personal API token reuse those OAuth tokens automatically. Service account API keys cannot fall back to user auth as they are not associated with a user.

`local.settingSources` does not apply to cloud agents.

### Local

```typescript
const agent = await Agent.create({
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
  model: { id: "auto" },
  local: { cwd: process.cwd() },
  mcpServers: {
    docs: {
      type: "http",
      url: "https://example.com/mcp",
      auth: {
        CLIENT_ID: "client-id",
        scopes: ["read", "write"],
      },
    },
    filesystem: {
      type: "stdio",
      command: "npx",
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", process.cwd()],
      cwd: process.cwd(),
    },
  },
});
```

### Cloud

Cloud agents can receive authenticated MCP configs inline too. Use HTTP auth when Cursor should proxy a remote MCP through the backend. Use stdio `env` when the server runs inside the cloud VM and reads credentials from environment variables.

```typescript
const agent = await Agent.create({
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
  model: { id: "composer-2.5" },
  cloud: {
    repos: [{ url: "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo", startingRef: "main" }],
  },
  mcpServers: {
    linear: {
      type: "http",
      url: "https://mcp.linear.app/sse",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LINEAR_API_KEY!}`,
      },
    },
    figma: {
      type: "http",
      url: "https://api.figma.com/mcp",
      auth: {
        CLIENT_ID: process.env.FIGMA_CLIENT_ID!,
        CLIENT_SECRET: process.env.FIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET!,
        scopes: ["file_content:read"],
      },
    },
    github: {
      type: "stdio",
      command: "npx",
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      env: {
        GITHUB_TOKEN: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN!,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Use `headers` for static API keys or Bearer tokens — Cursor passes them through on every request. Use `auth` for OAuth-protected servers. For cloud, Cursor runs the OAuth flow once server-side and reuses the token across runs. Locally, the SDK can't open a browser to sign you in; it only reuses tokens you've already obtained by signing in through the Cursor app.

- HTTP `headers` and `auth` are handled by Cursor's backend. Sensitive fields are redacted and do not enter the VM.
- Stdio `env` values are passed into the VM because the server runs there. Treat them like any other runtime secret.
- OAuth for MCP servers configured on cursor.com/agents stays per-user, even for team-level servers.

See [MCP](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp.md) for the full config format and [Cloud Agent capabilities](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/capabilities.md#mcp-tools) for cloud-specific behavior.

## Subagents

Define named subagents that the main agent spawns via the `Agent` tool. Pass them inline:

```typescript
const agent = await Agent.create({
  model: { id: "composer-2.5" },
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
  local: { cwd: process.cwd() },
  agents: {
    "code-reviewer": {
      description: "Expert code reviewer for quality and security.",
      prompt: "Review code for bugs, security issues, and proven approaches.",
      model: "inherit",
    },
    "test-writer": {
      description: "Writes tests for code changes.",
      prompt: "Write comprehensive tests for the given code.",
    },
  },
});
```

Subagents committed to the repo at `.cursor/agents/*.md` (with `name`, `description`, and optional `model` frontmatter) are also picked up. Inline definitions override file-based ones with the same name.

### Nested subagents

Subagents can spawn their own subagents, within a nesting limit. When a subagent uses the `Agent` tool, the SDK hands it the same subagent executor the parent has, so a parent can delegate to a subagent that delegates further. Each level reaches the same set of named subagents and [custom tools](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript.md#custom-tools). The top-level agent and its direct subagents can launch subagents, but a subagent launched by another subagent can't launch further ones.

## Custom tools

Custom tools let you expose your own functions to the agent without standing up a separate MCP server. Pass them on `local.customTools` and the SDK registers them as an MCP server named `custom-user-tools`. The agent discovers and calls them through the same MCP path as any other server, under the same [permission gate](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/tools/terminal.md#run-mode). Custom tools reach [subagents](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript.md#subagents) (including nested ones) too.

Custom tools are local agents only. Passing `local.customTools` to a cloud agent throws a `ConfigurationError`.

```typescript
const agent = await Agent.create({
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
  model: { id: "composer-2.5" },
  local: {
    cwd: process.cwd(),
    customTools: {
      get_deployment_status: {
        description: "Look up the current deployment status for a service.",
        inputSchema: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            service: { type: "string", description: "Service name" },
          },
          required: ["service"],
        },
        async execute({ service }) {
          const res = await fetch(`https://deploys.internal/api/${service}`);
          const body = await res.json();
          return `Service ${service} is ${body.status} (build ${body.build}).`;
        },
      },
    },
  },
});

await agent.send("Is the checkout service deployed yet?").then((r) => r.wait());
```

Set custom tools once on `Agent.create()` to apply them to every run, or pass `local.customTools` on a single `agent.send()` to replace them for that run.

```typescript
await agent.send("Roll forward if the canary is healthy", {
  local: {
    customTools: {
      promote_canary: {
        description: "Promote the current canary build to production.",
        async execute() {
          await promoteCanary();
          return { content: [{ type: "text", text: "Promoted." }] };
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Tool definition

```typescript
interface SDKCustomTool {
  description?: string;
  inputSchema?: Record<string, SDKJsonValue>;
  execute: (
    args: Record<string, SDKJsonValue>,
    context: SDKCustomToolContext
  ) => SDKCustomToolResult | Promise<SDKCustomToolResult>;
}

interface SDKCustomToolContext {
  toolCallId?: string;
}
```

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `description` | Shown to the model so it knows when to call the tool. Defaults to an empty string.                                                             |
| `inputSchema` | JSON Schema for the arguments. Defaults to an open object that accepts any properties.                                                         |
| `execute`     | Your callback. Receives the parsed `args` and a `context` with the `toolCallId`. Runs in your process, so it can reach anything your code can. |

### Tool results

`execute` can return a plain string, any JSON value, or a structured envelope. The map key is the tool name the model calls.

```typescript
type SDKCustomToolResult =
  | string
  | SDKJsonValue
  | {
      content: SDKCustomToolContent[];
      isError?: boolean;
      structuredContent?: Record<string, SDKJsonValue>;
    };

type SDKCustomToolContent =
  | { type: "text"; text: string }
  | { type: "image"; data: string; mimeType?: string };
```

- Return a string for plain text output.
- Return any JSON value to send it back as text; objects also populate `structuredContent`.
- Return the envelope for full control: mix text and base64 image `content`, set `isError: true` to report a failure, or attach `structuredContent` for the model to parse. Throwing from `execute` is also reported back to the agent as a tool error.

## Hooks

Hooks are file-based only. There is no programmatic hook callback. Hooks are a project policy boundary, not a per-run knob.

- **Local:** Add `.cursor/hooks.json` to the repo passed as `local.cwd`, or add `~/.cursor/hooks.json` for user-level hooks.
- **Cloud:** Commit `.cursor/hooks.json` and its scripts to the repo passed in `cloud.repos`. SDK-created cloud agents load project hooks automatically. On Enterprise plans, they also run team hooks and enterprise-managed hooks.

See [Hooks](https://cursor.com/docs/hooks.md) for the configuration format and [Cloud Agents hooks support](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent.md#hooks-support) for cloud behavior.

## Sandbox options

Local agents run with `local.sandboxOptions.enabled: false` by default. The agent can read and write the working directory, execute shell commands, and reach the network without restriction. There's no human-in-the-loop approval flow in headless SDK runs, so a sandbox-by-default would either block legitimate tool calls silently or require a callback that doesn't fit a script.

When you enable the sandbox, the SDK constrains every shell tool call and shell-spawned process:

- **Filesystem** — Writes are limited to the working directory (`local.cwd`) and a small set of allowed paths. Reads outside the workspace are blocked.
- **Shell** — Commands run inside a platform sandbox (`bubblewrap` on Linux, `seatbelt` on macOS, the bundled `@cursor/sdk-<os>-<arch>` helper). Privileged operations are denied.
- **Network** — Outbound network is denied by default. To allow specific hosts, drop a `.cursor/sandbox.json` in the workspace listing the allowed hosts. The SDK reads the same per-user policy at `~/.cursor/sandbox.json` if present.

```typescript
const agent = await Agent.create({
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
  model: { id: "composer-2.5" },
  local: {
    cwd: process.cwd(),
    sandboxOptions: { enabled: true },
  },
});
```

If sandboxing isn't supported on the host (older Linux without `bubblewrap`, missing helper binary), the SDK throws a `ConfigurationError` with a message that names the missing dependency. Disable `sandboxOptions.enabled` or run in cloud mode to recover.

Cloud runs always execute inside an isolated VM, so `sandboxOptions` doesn't apply.

## Auto-review

By default a local agent runs every tool call without restriction, since headless runs have no human to approve them. Set `local.autoReview: true` to route local tool calls through [Auto-review](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/tools/terminal.md#run-mode) instead, the same classifier the IDE uses to allow or block Shell, MCP, and Fetch calls based on safety and how well each call matches the run's intent.

```typescript
const agent = await Agent.create({
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
  model: { id: "composer-2.5" },
  local: {
    cwd: process.cwd(),
    autoReview: true,
  },
});
```

Auto-review needs the classifier enabled on the connected backend; when it isn't available, runs fall back to the default behavior. Because there's no interactive approval in a headless run, a call the classifier blocks is denied rather than escalated, and the agent gets the block reason and can try another approach. Steer the classifier with a `permissions.json` `autoRun` block in the workspace, the same as in the IDE. See [permissions.json](https://cursor.com/docs/reference/permissions.md) for the format.

Auto-review is local agents only. Cloud runs already execute in an isolated VM. The classifier is best-effort convenience, not a security boundary; combine it with [`sandboxOptions`](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript.md#sandbox-options) or an [allowlist](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/tools/terminal.md#run-mode) for strict control.

## Artifacts

List and download files from the agent's workspace.

```typescript
interface SDKArtifact {
  path: string;
  sizeBytes: number;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

```typescript
const artifacts: SDKArtifact[] = await agent.listArtifacts();

for (const artifact of artifacts) {
  console.log(artifact.path, artifact.sizeBytes);
}

const buffer = await agent.downloadArtifact(artifacts[0].path);
```

Artifact support is runtime-dependent. Local SDK agents currently return no artifacts and throw for `downloadArtifact`.

## Resource management

Always dispose agents when done. The cleanest pattern is `await using`:

```typescript
await using agent = await Agent.create({ /* ... */ });
// disposed automatically when the block exits
```

To dispose explicitly:

```typescript
await agent[Symbol.asyncDispose]();
```

`agent.close()` is the documented way to start disposal without awaiting. `Symbol.asyncDispose` works (`await using` is built on it) but `close()` is the path you should reach for in code that doesn't use the `await using` syntax. `agent.reload()` picks up filesystem config changes (hooks, project MCP, subagents) without disposing.

## Agent lifecycle

### Reattach to an existing agent

`Agent.resume(agentId)` returns a fresh handle to an agent that already exists. The runtime is auto-detected from the ID prefix (`bc-` is cloud, anything else is local), and conversation state is loaded from the cloud (cloud) or the local checkpoint store (local). This is how you continue work after a process restart, or how a different worker picks up an agent another process started.

```typescript
const agent = await Agent.resume("bc-abc123", {
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
});

const run = await agent.send("Apply the suggested fix");
const result = await run.wait();
```

If the run was already running when you reattached, `Agent.getRun(runId, { runtime: "cloud", agentId })` (or the local equivalent) returns a `Run` you can `stream()`, `wait()`, or `cancel()` against.

### Conversation context

Local agents persist conversation state in a checkpoint store. By default this is on-disk SQLite under your home directory; swap it for JSONL or a custom backend with [`local.store`](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript.md#local-agent-stores). Each call to `agent.send()` loads the latest checkpoint for that agent and passes it to the model, so follow-ups see the same context the previous run finished with. The store survives process restarts, which means `Agent.resume(agentId)` from a brand-new process picks up where the previous one left off.

Cloud agents persist state server-side. Reattaching from anywhere returns the same conversation.

A few things that look like context loss but aren't:

- A new `Agent.create()` always starts a fresh agent with a new `agentId`. To continue an existing conversation, capture `agent.agentId` from the first call and use `Agent.resume(agentId)` later.
- `Agent.prompt()` creates, runs, and disposes in one shot. There's no second turn; that's the contract.
- Inline `mcpServers` aren't persisted across `Agent.resume()` because they often carry secrets. Pass them again on resume, or use file-based MCP config.

### Dispatcher pattern

A dispatcher owns a pool of agents and hands work to them as it arrives. The shape is straightforward: keep a map of `agentId` to long-lived `SDKAgent`, route incoming prompts by some key (user, repo, ticket), and `Agent.resume()` from disk if a process restart wiped the in-memory map.

```typescript
import { Agent, type SDKAgent } from "@cursor/sdk";

const agents = new Map<string, SDKAgent>();

async function getAgent(key: string, savedId?: string): Promise<SDKAgent> {
  const existing = agents.get(key);
  if (existing) return existing;

  const agent = savedId
    ? await Agent.resume(savedId, {
        apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
      })
    : await Agent.create({
        apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
        model: { id: "composer-2.5" },
        local: { cwd: process.cwd() },
      });

  agents.set(key, agent);
  return agent;
}

async function handleMessage(key: string, prompt: string, savedId?: string) {
  const agent = await getAgent(key, savedId);
  const run = await agent.send(prompt);
  return run.wait();
}
```

Cloud SSE streams retain backlog for a window after the run starts, so a dispatcher that streams to many subscribers can call `run.stream()` from each subscriber without losing earlier events. For really long-running cloud runs, dispatchers usually fan out to `run.wait()` and let subscribers poll `run.conversation()` if they need the structured transcript.

## Local agent stores

Local agents persist agent metadata, conversation checkpoints, runs, and run events to disk so that follow-ups and `Agent.resume()` survive process restarts. By default the SDK uses `SqliteLocalAgentStore`, an on-disk SQLite store under a state root in your home directory. You can swap in a different backend with `local.store`.

The SDK ships two backends and lets you bring your own:

| Store                    | Import               | When to use                                                                                                          |
| :----------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SqliteLocalAgentStore`  | `@cursor/sdk/sqlite` | On-disk SQLite under the workspace state root.                                                                       |
| `JsonlLocalAgentStore`   | `@cursor/sdk`        | Portable newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON) files under a directory you choose. Easy to inspect, copy, and diff.        |
| Custom `LocalAgentStore` | Your code            | Persist to anything: in-memory, Redis, Postgres, or a hosted database. Implement the interface or compose substores. |

Cloud agents persist server-side, so `local.store` applies to local agents only.

### JSONL store

`JsonlLocalAgentStore` writes four NDJSON files (`agents.ndjson`, `runs.ndjson`, `run_events.ndjson`, `checkpoints.ndjson`) under the directory you pass. Construct one and pass it on `local.store`.

```typescript
import { Agent, JsonlLocalAgentStore } from "@cursor/sdk";

const store = new JsonlLocalAgentStore("/var/lib/cursor-agents");

const agent = await Agent.create({
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
  model: { id: "composer-2.5" },
  local: { cwd: process.cwd(), store },
});
```

Pass the same store instance on `Agent.resume()` and on the local list and get APIs (`Agent.list`, `Agent.get`, `Agent.listRuns`, `Agent.getRun`) so they read the same data.

### Set a process-wide default

To avoid threading a store through every call, set a default once with [`Cursor.configure()`](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript.md#cursorconfigure). Per-call `local.store` still wins when you pass it.

```typescript
import { Cursor, JsonlLocalAgentStore } from "@cursor/sdk";

Cursor.configure({ local: { store: new JsonlLocalAgentStore("/var/lib/cursor-agents") } });

// Later calls use the configured store unless they pass their own.
const agent = await Agent.create({
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
  model: { id: "composer-2.5" },
  local: { cwd: process.cwd() },
});
```

Pass `store: null` to `Cursor.configure({ local: { store: null } })` to clear a previous default and return to the SDK's default local store selection.

### Custom stores

To persist somewhere else (a shared Postgres, Redis, or an in-memory map for tests), implement `LocalAgentStore`. It's four substores, each a small CRUD surface the SDK calls:

```typescript
interface LocalAgentStore {
  readonly agents: LocalAgentStoreAgents;         // agent metadata rows
  readonly checkpoints: LocalAgentStoreCheckpoints; // content-addressed conversation blobs
  readonly runs: LocalAgentStoreRuns;             // run rows
  readonly runEvents: LocalAgentStoreRunEvents;   // append-only run event log
}
```

Implement the interface directly, or build each substore separately and combine them with `composeLocalAgentStore`:

```typescript
import { composeLocalAgentStore } from "@cursor/sdk";

const store = composeLocalAgentStore({
  agents: myAgentsTable,
  checkpoints: myCheckpointBlobs,
  runs: myRunsTable,
  runEvents: myRunEventLog,
});
```

The substores mirror the default SQLite tables: `agents` holds one row per agent (with a slim `latestCheckpoint.rootBlobId` pointer), `checkpoints` holds the content-addressed conversation blobs those pointers reference, `runs` holds one row per run, and `runEvents` is the append-only stream log. Catalog substores paginate with an opaque `cursor` / `nextCursor`; the run event log resumes with an exclusive `afterOffset` / `nextOffset`. See the exported `LocalAgentStore`, `LocalAgentDocument`, `LocalAgentRunDocument`, and related types for the exact shapes.

### AgentDefinition

| Property      | Type                                               | Default     | Description                                                                                     |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `description` | `string`                                           | *required*  | When to use this subagent. Shown to the parent agent so it knows when to spawn.                 |
| `prompt`      | `string`                                           | *required*  | System prompt for the subagent.                                                                 |
| `model`       | `ModelSelection \| "inherit"`                      | `"inherit"` | Model override. Pass `"inherit"` to use the parent's selection.                                 |
| `mcpServers`  | `Array<string \| Record<string, McpServerConfig>>` |             | MCP servers available to this subagent. Names reference servers from the parent's `mcpServers`. |

### ModelSelection

```typescript
interface ModelSelection {
  id: string;
  params?: ModelParameterValue[];
}

interface ModelParameterValue {
  id: string;
  value: string;
}
```

`id` is the model identifier (for example, `"composer-2.5"`). `params` carries per-model parameters such as reasoning effort. Use [`Cursor.models.list()`](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript.md#cursormodelslist) to discover valid ids, parameter definitions, and preset variants for your account.

### McpServerConfig

```typescript
type McpServerConfig =
  // stdio
  | {
      type?: "stdio";
      command: string;
      args?: string[];
      env?: Record<string, string>;
      cwd?: string;       // local only; cloud rejects this field
    }
  // HTTP / SSE
  | {
      type?: "http" | "sse";
      url: string;
      headers?: Record<string, string>;   // passed through; Authorization here works
      auth?: {
        CLIENT_ID: string;
        CLIENT_SECRET?: string;
        scopes?: string[];
      };
    };
```

For HTTP servers running in the cloud, `headers` and `auth` are handled by Cursor's backend. Sensitive fields are redacted before the VM sees them. For stdio servers in the cloud, `env` values are passed into the VM (treat them like any runtime secret).

### SDKUserMessage

```typescript
interface SDKUserMessage {
  text: string;
  images?: SDKImage[];
}
```

The structured form of `agent.send()`'s message argument. Use it to send images alongside text.

### SDKImage

```typescript
type SDKImage =
  | { url: string; dimension?: SDKImageDimension }
  | { data: string; mimeType: string; dimension?: SDKImageDimension };

interface SDKImageDimension {
  width: number;
  height: number;
}
```

Pass either a remote `url` or base64 `data` with a `mimeType`.

### SettingSource

```typescript
type SettingSource =
  | "project"
  | "user"
  | "team"
  | "mdm"
  | "plugins"
  | "all";
```

Controls which on-disk settings layers a local agent loads. Cloud agents always load `project` / `team` / `plugins` and ignore this field.

| Value       | Source                                  |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `"project"` | `.cursor/` in the workspace             |
| `"user"`    | `~/.cursor/`                            |
| `"team"`    | Team settings synced from the dashboard |
| `"mdm"`     | MDM-managed enterprise settings         |
| `"plugins"` | Plugin-provided settings                |
| `"all"`     | Shorthand for all of the above          |

### ListResult

```typescript
interface ListResult<T> {
  items: T[];
  nextCursor?: string;
}
```

Returned by `Agent.list()` and `Agent.listRuns()`. `nextCursor` is absent when there are no more pages.

## Errors

All SDK errors extend `CursorSdkError` (re-exported as `CursorAgentError` for backwards compatibility). Use `isRetryable` to drive retry logic, and `code` / `status` / `requestId` for diagnostics.

```typescript
class CursorSdkError extends Error {
  readonly isRetryable: boolean;
  readonly code?: string;       // stable SDK / backend code
  readonly status?: number;     // HTTP status if available
  readonly cause?: unknown;     // wrapped underlying error
  readonly endpoint?: string;
  readonly requestId?: string;
  readonly operation?: string;  // SDK operation that produced the error
}
```

### Check error.helpUrl

Some errors carry a one-click resolution link. The most common is
`IntegrationNotConnectedError`, but more error types may add `helpUrl` over
time. When you catch an error, log `error.helpUrl` if present and surface it
to the user.

### IntegrationNotConnectedError

```typescript
class IntegrationNotConnectedError extends ConfigurationError {
  readonly provider: string;   // e.g. "github", "gitlab", "azuredevops"
  readonly helpUrl: string;    // dashboard link to reconnect
}
```

The default error message doesn't include `helpUrl`, so log it explicitly:

```typescript
import { Agent, IntegrationNotConnectedError } from "@cursor/sdk";

try {
  await Agent.create({
    apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY!,
    cloud: {
      repos: [{ url: "https://github.com/your-org/private-repo" }],
    },
  });
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof IntegrationNotConnectedError) {
    console.error(err.provider, err.helpUrl);
  }
}
```

### AgentBusyError

```typescript
class AgentBusyError extends CursorAgentError {}
```

`isRetryable` is `false` for `agent_busy`. Retrying immediately will keep failing until the active run reaches a terminal status or you cancel it. Other `409` responses, such as `agent_archived`, throw `ConfigurationError` instead.

Wait for the active run to finish, cancel it with `run.cancel()`, or poll `Agent.listRuns()` before sending again:

```typescript
import { Agent, AgentBusyError } from "@cursor/sdk";

const agent = await Agent.resume("bc-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001");

try {
  await agent.send({ text: "Also add tests for the auth middleware." });
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof AgentBusyError) {
    const runs = await Agent.listRuns(agent.agentId, { runtime: "cloud", limit: 1 });
    const active = runs.items[0];
    if (active?.status === "running") {
      await active.cancel();
    }
    await agent.send({ text: "Also add tests for the auth middleware." });
    return;
  }
  throw err;
}
```

Local agents do not return `agent_busy`. Use `send({ local: { force: true } })` to expire a stuck local run before starting a new one.

### UnsupportedRunOperationError

```typescript
class UnsupportedRunOperationError extends ConfigurationError {
  readonly operation: RunOperation;
}
```

Thrown when a `Run` operation isn't available on the current runtime. Use `run.supports(operation)` and `run.unsupportedReason(operation)` to check before calling.

## Known limitations

- Inline `mcpServers` are not persisted across `Agent.resume()`. Pass them again on resume if needed.
- Custom tools (`local.customTools`), Auto-review (`local.autoReview`), and custom stores (`local.store`) are local agents only. Cloud agents reject `local.customTools` and persist server-side.
- Artifact download is not implemented for local agents (`agent.listArtifacts()` returns an empty list and `agent.downloadArtifact()` throws).
- `local.settingSources` (and the file-based MCP / subagent paths it gates) does not apply to cloud agents. Cloud always loads `project` / `team` / `plugins`.
- Hooks are file-based only (`.cursor/hooks.json`). No programmatic callbacks.
- The SDK doesn't auto-discover credentials from a local Cursor app installation. Set `CURSOR_API_KEY` (or pass `apiKey`) explicitly.
- Local mode requires Node.js 22.13 or later and platform sandbox-helper support. `SqliteLocalAgentStore` uses Node's `node:sqlite`; switch to `JsonlLocalAgentStore` or a custom `local.store` to avoid SQLite storage.
