# SDK Changelog

The latest features, improvements, and fixes shipping to the Cursor SDK, covering `@cursor/sdk` on npm and `cursor-sdk` on PyPI.

## 1.0.24

- **TypeScript and Python now release together.** Starting with 1.0.24, `@cursor/sdk` on npm and `cursor-sdk` on PyPI ship from the same release and share a version number. Python releases no longer trail TypeScript.
- **More reliable long-running streams.** Streaming responses on heavy runs no longer drop mid-stream, which previously surfaced as network errors in Python clients on long turns.

## 1.0.23

- **Per-send environment variables for cloud runs.** Pass `send(prompt, { cloud: { envVars } })` to scope env vars to a single run, including the first send that creates the agent. `Agent.create({ cloud: { envVars } })` still sets agent-scoped defaults.
- **Error details on failed runs.** Local and cloud runs that fail now expose a structured error with `message` and `code` fields, so you can tell what went wrong without parsing logs. `run.wait()` behaves the same as before.
- **Token usage in Python.** Run streams emit typed `usage` messages with per-turn token counts, and cumulative totals are available on `run.usage` and `RunResult.usage`, matching TypeScript from 1.0.22.
- **Sturdier local run history.** Run history on disk now survives interrupted writes, fixing a class of failures where a crashed process left runs that could not be resumed.
- **Fixed streaming stalls on Bun.** Run streams under Bun no longer stall on long responses.

## 1.0.22

- **Token usage on every run.** Local runs emit per-turn `usage` events on `run.stream()` and cumulative totals on `run.wait()`. Cloud runs surface the same usage on their stream and `wait()` results, and totals persist for detached local handles so a process that reattaches still gets them.

## 1.0.21

- **Run agents under Bun.** `agent.send()` now works under Bun with the same behavior as Node. This also fixes fresh Node installs that could miss a required dependency.
- **Friendlier runtime names in Python.** List APIs and `get_run` accept `runtime="cloud"`, `"local"`, and `"auto"`, matching the documented values.

## 1.0.20

- **The SDK imports cleanly under Bun.** Importing `@cursor/sdk` no longer crashes under Bun. Running agents under Bun follows in 1.0.21.
