# Grok Bot inference hooks

Inference hooks send every governed Grok Bot model request to an AI security server your organization runs or uses through a security vendor. Cursor signs each request, waits for an allow or deny verdict, and stops the request on a deny, so your policy checks prompts and the content Grok Bot gathers before a model sees them. For Grok Bot's other controls, see [Grok Bot security](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/security.md).

### Beta

Inference hooks are in beta for Enterprise teams. Contact your account manager
to enable them for your team. They cover Grok Bot only. See
[Coverage](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/inference-hooks.md#coverage).

## How it works

- **Each governed model request is checked.** Before Grok Bot calls a model, Cursor sends your endpoint a signed `prompt` frame with the conversation so far and holds the request until a verdict arrives or the timeout passes. A turn that calls the model several times, for example between tool calls, sends one frame per call.
- **Your server decides.** `allow` lets the request go to the model. `deny` stops it, ends the turn, and the member who sent the message sees a [block notice](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/inference-hooks.md#what-members-see).
- **Failures follow your mode.** When your endpoint times out, returns an error, or answers with something other than a verdict, the [mode](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/inference-hooks.md#modes) decides whether the request proceeds or is blocked. A failure never counts as a deny.
- **Only model inputs are checked.** Your endpoint judges what is about to go to the model. A tool call and its result appear in a frame only after the tool has run. Grok Bot's reply to a member is a tool call too, so the reply reaches the member before any frame contains it. A deny stops the next model call, not an action that already happened.

## Set up inference hooks

You need to be a team admin on an Enterprise team that has inference hooks turned on.

### Prepare your security server

Create an inference hooks integration in your security vendor's console, or
host your own server that meets the [endpoint
requirements](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/inference-hooks.md#endpoint-requirements). The setup dialog's **Security Vendor**
list includes vendor presets with a setup checklist.

### Open Inference Hooks

In the Cursor dashboard, select the team, then open [Inference
Hooks](https://cursor.com/dashboard/bot/inference-hooks) from the **Security &
Compliance** section of the Grok Bot page.

### Add the endpoint

Click **Set Up Endpoint**, choose your vendor or **Custom Endpoint**, and
enter the **Endpoint URL** and any **Custom Headers** your server needs, such
as its API key. Cursor checks the URL when you save.

### Copy the signing secret

The first save that sets an endpoint generates a signing secret starting with
`whsec_` and shows it once. Paste it into your vendor's webhook secret field,
or your server's configuration, so it can verify each request.

### Test the connection

Click **Test Connection**. Cursor sends a synthetic request and shows the
verdict or the reason the check failed. A deny here means your policy would
block the test prompt, so fix that before you enforce.

### Start in Shadow mode

New configurations start in **Shadow Mode**. Turn on **Enforce Verdicts** to
start sending. Your endpoint receives every covered request and denials are
recorded in the audit log, but nothing is blocked. Once the verdicts look
right, set **Mode** under **Failure Handling** to **Allow the Request** or
**Block the Request**.

Setting changes take effect within about a minute, and requests already in flight finish under the old settings.

While an endpoint is saved, **Enforce Verdicts** is on, and Grok Bot is covered, in any mode and at any rollout percentage, Grok Bot skips some model calls it would otherwise make ahead of a turn, so replies can start more slowly.

### Endpoint requirements

- **Use an `https://` URL on port 443.** The host must be publicly routable and present a certificate from a public certificate authority. Cursor refuses private, loopback, and carrier-grade NAT addresses.
- **Redirects and tunnels don't work.** Cursor doesn't follow redirects and treats one as a failed check. Reverse-tunnel hosts aren't accepted.
- **Keep secrets out of the URL.** The URL can't carry credentials, a query string, or a fragment, because admins see it in plain text. Put credentials in custom headers, which are stored encrypted. URLs are limited to 2,048 characters.
- **Answer every request with a verdict.** Return HTTP 200 and a JSON verdict, including for Test Connection. See [Verdicts](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/inference-hooks.md#verdicts).

### Custom headers

- **You can add up to 16 headers.** Names use letters, digits, and hyphens, without underscores, up to 128 characters. Values are printable ASCII, up to 8,192 characters.
- **Values are write-only.** After you save, the page shows header names only. Changing any header means entering every value again.
- **A new URL clears saved values.** Header values never go to an endpoint they weren't saved for. After you change the URL, re-enter them in **Edit**. Until you do, requests go out without them.
- **Cursor owns some headers.** You can't add `Host`, `Cookie`, `User-Agent`, `Accept-Encoding`, connection headers such as `Transfer-Encoding`, client-address headers such as `X-Real-IP`, or any name starting with `Content-`, `Proxy-`, `X-Forwarded-`, `Webhook-`, or `X-Cursor-`.

### Signing secret

Every request carries [Standard Webhooks](https://www.standardwebhooks.com) headers so your server can reject anything Cursor didn't send:

| Header              | Value                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `webhook-id`        | The frame's `request_id`                                                                                                                            |
| `webhook-timestamp` | Unix time in seconds                                                                                                                                |
| `webhook-signature` | `v1,` then the base64 HMAC-SHA256 of `{webhook-id}.{webhook-timestamp}.{raw body}`, keyed with the base64-decoded part of the secret after `whsec_` |

Each request carries exactly one signature. To rotate the secret, click **Rotate Secret** under **Request Signing**. The new secret is shown once, and Cursor starts signing with it within about a minute, so keep accepting the previous secret until then. Rotating counts as a settings change for the [circuit breaker](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/inference-hooks.md#circuit-breaker).

### Test Connection

Test Connection sends a signed `prompt` frame with `source.application` set to `config-test`, a fixed message that contains no user content, and no member, session, or model. It signs with your saved secret and waits for your saved verdict timeout. It uses the URL and headers in the form when you run it from the endpoint dialog, and the saved ones when you run it from the page.

| Result                  | Meaning                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Allow or deny           | Your server returned a verdict. Resolve a deny before you enforce         |
| URL rejected            | The URL doesn't meet the endpoint requirements                            |
| Private or internal IP  | The host isn't a publicly routable address                                |
| Timeout                 | No verdict arrived within the verdict timeout                             |
| Transport error         | DNS, connection, or TLS failure                                           |
| Non-200 status          | Your server answered with a status other than 200, including a redirect   |
| Unparseable response    | The body wasn't a JSON verdict, was compressed, or was larger than 64 KiB |
| Signing secret required | Save the configuration first. Saving generates the secret                 |

## Modes

**Enforce Verdicts** turns sending on and off. While it's off, Cursor sends nothing and keeps your settings. While it's on, **Mode** decides what happens when a check can't finish:

| Mode                      | On a deny                | When the check fails                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shadow Mode** (default) | Lets the request through | Lets the request through                          |
| **Allow the Request**     | Blocks the request       | Lets the request through uninspected (fails open) |
| **Block the Request**     | Blocks the request       | Blocks the request (fails closed)                 |

In Allow and Block modes the model request waits for the verdict. In Shadow mode Cursor sends the same frames at the same moments, but in the background: nothing waits, members see nothing, and denials and failures are recorded in the audit log. Under heavy load, Cursor can skip a Shadow check, and a skipped check writes no audit row.

A check fails when your server times out, answers with a status other than 200, returns a body that isn't a JSON verdict or is larger than 64 KiB, returns an `action` other than `allow` or `deny`, or can't be reached. A frame larger than 64 MiB also counts as a failure.

Once Cursor has your settings, Block mode blocks every check that can't
finish, including when the cause is on Cursor's side. If Cursor can't load
your team's inference hook settings at all, it can't tell which mode you
chose, so the request proceeds and the audit log records it as failed open
with reason `config_unavailable`.

### Verdict timeout

**Verdict Timeout (ms)** accepts 1 to 10,000 ms and defaults to 5,000. It covers the whole exchange: connection, TLS handshake, request, and response. If the connection fails, Cursor retries once within the same timeout, with the same `webhook-id` and signature, so you can deduplicate on `webhook-id`. Cursor never retries after your server responds. Its own processing adds up to about half a second on top of the timeout.

### Rollout

**Requests Inspected (%)** sends only a share of covered requests to your endpoint while you bring it up. The choice is sticky, so all the requests behind one turn, subagents included, are either inspected or skipped. Requests outside the share proceed uninspected even in Block mode, and 0% turns inspection off.

### Circuit breaker

Sustained failures your server is responsible for, such as timeouts, error statuses, TLS errors, and malformed verdicts, trip the circuit breaker. DNS and connection errors, URLs Cursor refuses, and frames over 64 MiB count as failures but never trip it.

- **While tripped, Cursor stops sending.** Your mode applies to every covered request: Block mode blocks them all, and Allow and Shadow let them through uninspected. The audit log records one `inference_hooks_circuit_breaker_tripped` event per trip and no per-request events while tripped.
- **Recovery is automatic.** Starting 10 minutes after the trip, Cursor periodically sends your server the Test Connection request. An allow or a deny resets the breaker.
- **Any settings change stops automatic recovery.** That includes rotating the secret. Once your endpoint is fixed, click **Reset**, or turn **Enforce Verdicts** off and on again.

### Cursor pause

Cursor can pause inference hooks for a team, or for everyone, in an emergency. While paused, Cursor sends no frames, covered requests proceed, and the audit log records most of them as failed open with reason `kill_switch`. Test Connection shows "Inference hooks are temporarily paused by Cursor."

## What members see

When your server denies a request, the Grok Bot desktop and mobile apps show a block notice to the member who sent the blocked message, in their own conversation with the Bot. On mobile, the notice sits above the message box. It shows:

- The title **Blocked by your organization's policy**.
- Your server's `deny_reason`, followed by your **Blocked Message**.
- Guidance with an **Edit** button and a **Reset** button. **Edit** takes the blocked message back out of the conversation and puts its text in the message box, unless the member already has a draft there, so they can send something different. **Reset** clears the conversation. The mobile app and newer versions of the desktop app ask the member to confirm first. When Cursor can't roll the conversation back to the point before the blocked message, only **Reset** appears.

**Blocked Message** accepts up to 500 characters and defaults to "Your organization's security policy blocked this request." Turn it off to show only your server's `deny_reason`. Use it to tell members what to do next, such as who to contact.

After a reset, the Bot no longer sees earlier messages in that conversation, and it stops the background helpers it was running for it. Other work it started, such as cloud agents and background commands, keeps going and can report back. Its memory, files, routines, and settings are kept. Edit rolls the conversation back to the point before the blocked message. Neither one undoes actions the Bot already took, such as files it wrote.

If the conversation is blocked again right after a reset, the notice has no buttons. It explains that what's blocked may be in the Bot's memory or files, and asks the member to remove it there or ask an admin for help.

When a check fails in Block mode, the desktop app shows **Your organization's policy check is unavailable** and "Your organization requires a policy check before the model responds, and the check didn't complete. Try again later, or contact your admin if this keeps happening." The mobile app shows "Your organization's policy check is unavailable. Try again later, or contact your admin if this keeps happening." Your Blocked Message isn't shown, and there's no Edit or Reset.

Other places show less:

- **Shared Bots notify only the sender.** In a team Bot, the notice and its buttons go only to the teammate who sent the blocked message, in their own chat with the Bot, and Edit or Reset changes only that chat. The Bot's owner isn't shown the deny reason or your Blocked Message. Rooms and group chats get no Edit or Reset buttons.
- **Slack replies in the conversation.** The Bot answers "Your organization's policy blocked this conversation, so I can't reply," and in a one-to-one DM it quotes the deny reason and your Blocked Message, which channel threads and group DMs never show. The reply offers **Remove blocked message**, which works like Edit, and **Reset**, which asks for confirmation first, or only **Reset** when Cursor can't roll the conversation back. Anyone who can use the Bot and has linked their Cursor account can click them. A removed message stays visible in Slack, but the Bot no longer sees it. A repeat block right after a reset gets no buttons, and a failed check in Block mode gets the Bot's generic error reply instead of a policy notice.
- **Elsewhere, the mobile app shows a plain failure.** In group chats and conversations that aren't the member's own, it shows "Bot failed to respond" with "Blocked by your organization's policy. Send a different message, or contact your admin if this keeps happening," without the deny reason, your Blocked Message, or buttons.
- **Other Cursor apps show only the title.**
- **Older desktop versions show no buttons.** Depending on the version, the notice shows the deny reason and your Blocked Message with the guidance "Send a different message, or start a new chat if this keeps happening," or only "Blocked by your organization's policy. Send a different message, or contact your admin if this keeps happening."
- **Background helpers stop without a notice.** When a helper Grok Bot started is blocked, the Bot learns your organization's policy stopped it, without the deny reason.
- **Routines stop and record the block.** The run history in the Cursor dashboard shows **Blocked by your organization's policy**, or **Your organization's policy check is unavailable** for a failed check in Block mode, with a fixed explanation and no deny reason. The Grok Bot app's routine list shows only that the run failed.
- **Email, Linear, and other connected channels get no reply.**

A blocked message stays in the conversation until someone takes it back or resets the conversation. Until then, Grok Bot sends it with every later request, so your server judges it again each time. A policy that scans the whole transcript keeps denying that conversation. A policy that judges the newest user message lets it continue once the member sends something different.

Members see nothing when a request is allowed or when you're in Shadow mode. Shadow mode sends their conversations to your endpoint too, so tell members your organization checks Grok Bot requests before you turn on **Enforce Verdicts**.

## Coverage

**Covered:** the model requests behind your team members' Grok Bot conversations. That includes every step of a turn, subagents, the summaries Grok Bot writes of long conversations, and routines. A team Bot or room follows its team's inference hook. A personal Bot follows the team its owner has selected. Each request gets its own frame with the conversation so far.

**Not covered:**

- **Model responses aren't checked.** See [How it works](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/inference-hooks.md#how-it-works).
- **Parts of a request that aren't conversation stay out.** System prompts, tool definitions, and the model's hidden reasoning never go to your endpoint, and Cursor leaves out most of the text it adds for the model, such as reminders and timestamps.
- **Ancillary model calls aren't sent.** These calls support a conversation rather than continue it, such as writing chat titles, Auto Review, and saving memories.
- **Other Cursor features aren't covered.** That includes Cloud Agents, agents in the editor, the CLI, the Agent SDK, Tab, embeddings, and local models.
- **Actions aren't checked as they run.** Tool execution, connected-app actions, and network traffic from a member's Grok Bot computer reach your endpoint only when their output returns to the model as a tool result in a later frame. Use the [network policy](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/security.md#network-policy) and [Auto Review](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/security.md#approvals-and-auto-review) to control actions.

## Request format

Cursor sends each frame as an HTTPS `POST` with a compact JSON body. Header names are lowercase.

| Header                                                 | Value                                                                                    |

| `accept-encoding`                                      | `identity`                                                                               |
| `webhook-id`, `webhook-timestamp`, `webhook-signature` | See [Signing secret](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/inference-hooks.md#signing-secret) |
| Your custom headers                                    | As saved                                                                                 |

Standard headers such as `host` and `content-length` come with every request too.

### Messages

- **Roles are `user` and `assistant`.** Tool results sit under `user`.
- **Blocks are `text`, `tool_use`, `tool_result`, and `attachment`.** A `tool_use` block names the tool and holds its `input`, and the matching `tool_result` holds the output. Context Grok Bot gives the model, such as rules, shared memory, and the connected apps it can use, usually arrives in an `attachment` block's `text`. An image is an `attachment` with its media type and size, but not its bytes or URL.
- **Every frame holds the whole conversation so far.** Frames aren't deltas, so each one carries the earlier messages again. In a long conversation, a summary Grok Bot writes takes the place of older messages.
- **Replies to members are tool calls.** Grok Bot sends what members read through a tool, so its replies appear in `tool_use` input, not in assistant `text`.
- **Cursor never adds secret values.** Context can name and describe the secrets a Bot can use, but never includes their values.

### Write policies for these frames

- **Verify the signature.** Don't rely on the User-Agent or source IP. If the Inference Hooks page lists **Source IP Ranges** under **Request Signing**, you can allowlist them as well.
- **Treat IDs as opaque strings.** Don't parse `tenant_id` or `actor.id`. Map members by `actor.id`, since frames carry no email.
- **Treat `source.application` as an open set.** Cursor adds values as coverage grows. It's advisory, not a security control.
- **Scan every block type, not only `text`.** Context usually arrives in attachment `text`, and replies to members and connected-app calls arrive in `tool_use` input.
- **Don't rely on `tool_result.is_error`.** It's `false` for most failed tool calls too.

### Verdicts

Answer with HTTP 200 and a JSON object:

```json
{
  "action": "deny",
  "deny_reason": "This message contains a customer account number. Remove it and try again.",
  "reference_id": "policy-7f3c21"
}
```

- **`action`** is `allow` or `deny`. Anything else is a failed check.
- **`deny_reason`** is shown in the block notice to the member who sent the message. Cursor truncates it to 500 characters.
- **`reference_id`** is your identifier for the decision, recorded in the Cursor audit log. Up to 50 characters from `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, and `.`, `_`, `:`, `/`, `-`. A malformed value is dropped and the deny still applies.
- **Unknown fields are ignored.** Cursor reads at most 64 KiB, uncompressed, and ignores cookies.

Answer `config-test` frames from Test Connection and circuit-breaker recovery with a verdict too, and keep them out of your reports on member traffic.

## Audit log

Inference hook activity appears in your team's [audit log](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring.md#audit-logs). Payloads carry identifiers and codes, never prompt content, the deny reason, the signing secret, or header values. An allowed request writes no event.

| `event_type`                               | When it fires                                                                                                                   | Fields                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `inference_hooks_circuit_breaker_tripped`  | Sustained failures tripped the circuit breaker                                                                                  | `config_version`, `mode`, `failure_count`, `window_seconds`, `last_failure_kind`                                                                                                                                           |

On `inference_hooks_signing_secret_generated`, the settings fields show the state after the change. A rotation bumps `config_version`. A first secret shares it with the `inference_hooks_config_updated` event from the same save.

Cursor records request failures in every mode, as failed open in Allow and Shadow and failed closed in Block, and it records automatic circuit-breaker recovery. `reason` on the failed-open and failed-closed events is a failure (`timeout`, `non_200_status`, `unparseable_response`, `oversized_response`, `invalid_action`, `transport_error`, `tls_error`, `endpoint_rejected`, `frame_too_large`), a Cursor-side cause (`endpoint_not_allowlisted`, `config_unavailable`), or, for failed open only, a pause (`kill_switch`). Build SIEM rules on these event names and `reason` values.

The `request_id` on denied and failed events matches the frame's `request_id` and `webhook-id`, so you can join your vendor's records to the audit log.

The Inference Hooks page also shows endpoint health: status, verdict latency, failures per minute, block rate over 24 hours, and recent errors with their type and status code. Its figures don't cover all traffic, so they can be lower than your vendor's counts.

## Privacy and Privacy Mode

- **Cursor doesn't keep what it sends to your hook.** Cursor sends each frame to your endpoint over HTTPS and discards it once the verdict arrives. Frame content isn't written to Cursor's databases, logs, metrics, or traces.
- **Your endpoint, your retention.** The endpoint belongs to your organization or your security vendor. What it stores, where, and for how long depends on your configuration and your agreement with that vendor. Cursor doesn't control that data.
- **Privacy Mode is unchanged.** The model request itself is handled exactly as it is without a hook, under your team's Privacy Mode setting, and the hook adds no copy of it. Inference hooks run for every covered member regardless of Privacy Mode, because your admins direct Cursor to send these requests to your own endpoint.
- **Frame fields identify people only by opaque IDs.** `actor.email_address` is always null.

Cursor keeps only what it needs to run the feature and show you what happened:

- **Your settings, with secrets encrypted.** Header values and the signing secret are stored encrypted.
- **Audit log events with identifiers and codes only.** They include your server's `reference_id`, as listed in [Audit log](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/inference-hooks.md#audit-log).
- **Health figures without content.** They hold counts, latencies, and recent error types and status codes.
- **The block notice, encrypted with the blocked turn.** Your server's `deny_reason` and your Blocked Message are stored, encrypted, with Grok Bot's record of the blocked turn.

## Troubleshooting

### Why don't I see Inference Hooks on the Grok Bot page?

The page appears for team admins on Enterprise teams that have inference
hooks turned on, and it shows the team selected in the dashboard. Check that
the right team is selected. If the page says "Inference hooks aren't
available yet," contact your account manager.

### Why is my endpoint URL rejected?

Check the [endpoint requirements](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/inference-hooks.md#endpoint-requirements). The usual causes
are a port other than 443, a query string or credentials in the URL, a tunnel
host, or a host that resolves to a private address.

### Why does Test Connection say a signing secret is required?

Cursor generates the secret on the first save that sets an endpoint. Save the
endpoint, copy the secret into your vendor's console, then test again.

### Why does my server reject Cursor's requests?

Most rejections are a signature or credential mismatch. Paste the current
signing secret into your server, including the `whsec_` prefix if your
verifier expects it, and check that it decodes the secret as standard base64.
Confirm your API key header is saved. If you changed the endpoint URL, re-enter
the header values. After a rotation, Cursor switches to the new secret within
about a minute.

### Why does Test Connection return a deny?

Your server's policy denies Cursor's synthetic test prompt. In Allow or Block
mode, a policy like that blocks members too. Adjust the policy or its default
action before you turn on enforcement.

### Why are requests timing out?

Your server took longer than the verdict timeout. Check verdict latency in the
health panel and your vendor's reports. Lighter scan profiles answer faster.
You can raise **Verdict Timeout (ms)** up to 10,000.

### Why isn't my endpoint receiving requests?

Check that an endpoint is saved, **Enforce Verdicts** is on, **Coverage**
includes Grok Bot, **Requests Inspected (%)** is above 0, and the circuit
breaker isn't tripped. Only Grok Bot conversations of your team's members are
covered. If Test Connection reports that inference hooks are paused, Cursor
has paused them.

### Why do members see that the policy check is unavailable?

You're in Block mode and the check failed, or the circuit breaker tripped.
Check **Recent Errors** on the Inference Hooks page. To keep members working
while you fix the endpoint, switch to **Allow the Request**.

### The circuit breaker tripped. How do I recover?

Fix the endpoint, run Test Connection, then click **Reset**. Automatic
recovery stops after any settings change, so don't wait for it if you edited
anything after the trip.

### Why is every message in a conversation blocked after one block?

The blocked message stays in the conversation and goes to your server with
every later request, so a policy that scans the whole transcript denies each
of them. Choose **Edit** on the block notice in the desktop or mobile app, or **Remove
blocked message** on the Bot's reply in Slack, to take the message back and
send something different. **Reset** clears the conversation instead. If the
conversation is blocked again right after a reset, what your policy matches
is likely in the Bot's memory or files. Remove it there. A policy that judges
the newest user message lets a conversation continue once the member sends
something different.

### Why don't inference hook events appear in the audit log filter?

The event types appear in the filter only while inference hooks are enabled
for your team. Events that were recorded still show in the log.
