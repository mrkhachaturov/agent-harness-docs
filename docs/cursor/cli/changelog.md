# CLI Changelog

The latest features, improvements, and fixes shipping to Cursor CLI. Run `agent --version` to check your installed version, and `agent update` to upgrade in place.

## June 29, 2026 release

### Workspaces and commands

- **Start multi-root sessions from the command line.** Repeat `--add-dir <path>` to add directories at launch, including with `--workspace`. `/add-dir` refreshes slash skills and custom commands immediately; restart only when you want the agent to discover new skills automatically.
- **Plugin reloads refresh commands.** Reloading a plugin refreshes its slash commands and palette. Long skill and custom-command names resolve correctly, and `/add-dir` keeps directory completion open while you browse.
- **Queued follow-ups send on the second Enter.** Press Enter again on an empty prompt to stop the current turn and send your queued message immediately, including while a `beforeSubmitPrompt` hook is running.
- **Fixed input lag during agent runs.** Typing and queuing follow-ups no longer rerender the full transcript on every keystroke while output streams.
- **Fixed model options resetting.** Changing Fast, reasoning effort, or context in `/model` preserves your other compatible choices and keeps Max Mode in sync.

### Cloud and Auto-review

- **Cloud transfers preserve model and workspace context.** For Git repositories with Cloud Agents access, transfers preserve the selected model and workspace path. The prompt shows transfer status, `Esc` or `Ctrl-C` cancels, and failure details remain visible.
- **Auto-review considers invoked instructions.** Admins can control availability. When Auto-review is enabled for your account and selected model, the classifier can inspect invoked skill and file-backed custom-command files before deciding whether a tool call needs approval. Existing hard approval boundaries are unchanged.

### Authentication and MCP

- **Run Cursor in sandboxes without macOS Keychain.** Set `AGENT_CLI_CREDENTIAL_STORE=file` to store credentials unencrypted in an owner-only file. Use private storage that persists across runs; packaged Unix builds also skip system CA loading in this mode.
- **Fixed false MCP connection errors.** Working servers no longer appear disconnected in `/mcp` and `agent mcp list` when their tools or instructions are available.

### Reliability and updates

- **Windows updates suppress PowerShell progress output.** Native updates no longer draw PowerShell's progress bar over the CLI or incur its download overhead.
- **Fixed memory growth in long CLI sessions.** The CLI now saves only new transcript entries at each checkpoint instead of reloading and rewriting the full conversation.

## June 22, 2026

### Auto-review

- **Auto-review run mode.** Cursor's Auto-review run mode comes to the CLI: a middle ground between Allowlist and Run Everything that keeps the agent moving with fewer approval prompts. Shell, MCP, and Fetch calls are checked in order: allowlisted calls run immediately, calls that can be sandboxed run in the sandbox, and the rest go to a classifier that allows the call, tries a different approach, or asks you to approve. Turn it on with `--auto-review`, in `/config`, or with `/auto-review`, and steer the classifier with `allow`/`block` instructions in `permissions.json`.

### Workspaces

- **Named multi-directory workspaces.** Run the agent across several repositories at once: add directories mid-session with `/add-dir`, save the set with `/save-workspace`, reload it later with `/load-workspace`, or start scoped with `--workspace`.

### Commands

- **`/rewind` is on by default.** The turn-by-turn undo timeline no longer needs turning on in `/config`.
- **`/vim` anywhere in the prompt.** Trigger inline Vim editing from any position, not just an empty prompt.
- **Richer `/copy`.** Pick a single step of a multi-step reply from a per-step picker, copy the agent's responses alongside your own messages, and copy long replies without the terminal stalling.
- **`/logs` on shared machines.** Debug logs are written per user so multi-user hosts don't hit permission errors, and the `/logs` path lingers on screen longer.

### Terminal experience

- **Prompt history is per conversation.** Up-arrow recalls what you typed in this session instead of a single history shared across every chat.
- **The jobs list shows everything running.** Foreground shells and subagents appear in the jobs pager alongside background tasks.
- **Steadier rendering.** Mermaid diagrams stay drawn after a turn finishes, long shell-output previews clip instead of wrapping, and the screen clears once per resize instead of twice.
- **Your draft survives the resume picker.** Cancelling `/resume` keeps what you had already typed.
- **Plan editing.** Esc returns to Vim normal mode while you revise a plan.

### Reliability

- **Lower memory in long sessions.** Fixed a leak where per-turn abort signals held on to conversation state.
- **No crash on missing approval state.** Sessions tolerate credential stores that haven't recorded an approval mode yet.

### MCP and skills

- **Editor-provided MCP servers are trusted.** MCP servers passed in over the Agent Client Protocol (Zed and other editors) load instead of being silently dropped.
- **MCP tools survive a plugin reload.** The MCP lease refreshes after a plugin reloads, so its tools no longer wedge with "Not connected" errors.
- **Skills found through symlinks.** The skills menu follows symlinked directories when discovering skills.

### Install and updates

- **Reliable channel switching.** Switching release channels applies on the first try and immediately fetches the target channel's build.
- **Windows and shim fixes.** The Windows launcher matches timestamped version directories, and the `cursor` shim no longer errors on shells that treat unset variables as failures.

### Enterprise and team controls

- **Team gating for Auto-review.** Admins control whether Auto-review is available to their members.
- **Stable self-hosted worker identity.** `worker start` waits for the bridge to connect before reporting ready, and workers keep a stable logical ID scoped per authenticated user, so fleets on shared machines match the right worker to the right person.

## June 9, 2026

### Terminal experience

- **Cleaner edit display.** File edits render borderless (an `Editing`/`Edited` header plus the diff), with memoized diff rendering so large edits don't slow the UI.
- **Faster, richer resume picker.** Session metadata is cached so `/resume` (Ctrl+Y) opens quickly even on network filesystems, with Created and Last updated columns and reliable ordering.
- **Working status pinned above the prompt.** Progress, token counts (with an optional elapsed-time display), and hints stay in one stable place.
- **Long shell output truncates from the top.** You see the latest output of a streaming command, not the oldest.
- **Wrapped URLs stay clickable.** Long links re-emit hyperlink codes on every wrapped line.
- **Model picker shows Max Mode state**, and the footer model summary drops redundant labels.

### Commands

- **`/fork`** Branch the current conversation into a copy and continue down a different path (aliases `/branch`, `/duplicate`).
- **`/update`** Update the CLI in place from inside the session.
- **`/context`** Visualize what's consuming the context window, broken down by category.
- **`/logs`** Debug logs are written for every session; `/logs` shows the path and copies it to the clipboard.
- **Background task controls.** Arrow-key navigation in the task viewer and a kill shortcut.

### Reliability

- **HTTP/2 keepalive pings.** Silent connection stalls mid-stream are detected in seconds and retried.
- **Transport interruptions retry automatically.** Network-level cancels and aborts no longer end the turn as if Ctrl+C had been pressed.
- **Freeze fixes.** Eliminated hard UI freezes caused by layout feedback loops, an input freeze after first-run onboarding, and swallowed or reordered keystrokes while pasting.
- **Faster first paint on slow networks.** Team settings lookups no longer block interactive startup (about 2 seconds on high-latency connections).
- **Works on restricted networks.** Feature defaults apply when corporate firewalls block the configuration service.
- **direnv support.** The agent's shell loads `.envrc` automatically, in interactive and agent-dispatched shells.
- **Drag-and-drop and paste fixes.** File drag-and-drop paths arrive intact, and pasting a copied image file on macOS attaches the actual image.

### Enterprise and team controls

- **Admins can disable headless mode.** A team setting blocks non-interactive CLI usage org-wide.
- **"Run Everything" controls.** Auto-run renamed consistently across the product; admin-controlled auto-run treats the command allowlist as the always-available baseline.
- **MCP user-extension governance.** Admin "Allow User Extension" toggles for MCP servers and tools are enforced at runtime.
- **Team-managed MCP servers.** Centrally configured servers load reliably, with server group selection; MCP tool policy is decoupled from the terminal auto-run setting.
- **MCP OAuth over SSH.** The CLI shows port-forwarding instructions when authenticating a remote MCP server from an SSH session.

## May 20, 2026

- **Composer 2.5 is the default model** for new CLI sessions.
- **`/summarize`.** Renamed from `/compress` to match the IDE; `/compact` and `/compress` remain as aliases, and aliases execute directly.
- **Local plugins via `~/.cursor/settings.json`.** Point an `enabled_plugins` key at local plugin folders; no marketplace needed.
- **Multi-root workers.** Self-hosted workers span multiple repositories with repeatable `--worker-dir` flags and keep a stable identity.
- **Rewind preserves images.** Rewinding to an earlier turn restores that turn's image attachments to the prompt.
- **Faster `/plugins`.** Quicker plugin details, with each plugin's MCP servers linked into `/mcp` management.
- **MCP tools refresh in-session.** Logging in, enabling, or disabling a server from `/mcp` updates the agent's available tools immediately.
- **Readable diffs in light mode.** Character-level diff highlights are legible on light terminal themes.
- **Hooks accept payloads over stdin.** Avoids argv length limits and keeps payloads out of process listings.

## May 14, 2026

- **Vim visual mode.** Visual selection with delete and change operators; the active Vim mode shows in the footer.
- **Ctrl+G opens your prompt in `$EDITOR`.** Compose long prompts in your real editor and drop the result back into the prompt bar.
- **MCP management revamped.** `/mcp` opens a per-server detail view: browse tool schemas, log in, log out (clears stored OAuth credentials), enable, and disable, all without leaving the session.
- **Headless runs wait for MCP tools.** Fixed a startup race where slow stdio MCP servers were missing from `-p` runs.
- **Nested rules and skills.** `.cursor/rules` and `.cursor/skills` in subdirectories are discovered everywhere, matching the IDE.
- **Long conversations redraw instantly.** Full repaints render only recent turns (`/full-conversation` to opt out), keeping resizes and resumes fast in old sessions.
- **Proxy support for agent streams.** `HTTPS_PROXY` is honored on the streaming connection, completing corporate proxy support end to end.
- **Auto-run survives resume.** Resuming a conversation recomputes Run Everything from your config and team policy.
- **Model variants work headless.** Fast or high-effort model slugs passed to `--model` keep their parameters in `-p` mode.
- **Early keystrokes are buffered** and replayed once the UI loads; stale input over SSH and tmux fixed.
- **tmux focus awareness.** The prompt cursor stops blinking in unfocused panes (with `focus-events on`).
- **Pathological diffs render safely.** Very long lines are capped before syntax highlighting, so minified files can't stall the UI.

## May 7, 2026

- **Plugin marketplaces.** Add a marketplace by git URL (`/plugin marketplace add`), browse and manage marketplaces by scope, see which marketplace each plugin came from, and load local plugin dirs with `--plugin-dir`. Plugins imported from Claude Code appear alongside native ones.
- **Ctrl+L clears the screen** like a shell: clears screen and scrollback, keeps your session running.
- **Smooth typing from the first keystroke.** Fixed an event-loop stall (about 1 second on large repos) that batched early keystrokes; closing pagers no longer repaints the whole screen.
- **Skills everywhere.** Skills load in interactive, headless, and editor-integration modes; `/skill-name` invocations work in `-p` print mode.
- **Linux clipboard image paste.** Paste images on Wayland and X11.
- **`/model` typeahead.** Type `/model sonnet` and the picker opens pre-filtered, without submitting your prompt.
- **Theme follows your terminal.** Switching your terminal between light and dark repaints the CLI automatically.
- **Stall detection with persistent retries.** Stalled streams are detected and retried instead of hanging, and the backend can fall back to HTTP/1 transport on networks where HTTP/2 misbehaves.
- **`/mcp` grouped by scope.** Servers are organized under User / Project / Team, and failed servers show their actual error.
- **Privacy hardening.** Conversation summarization fails closed for no-storage teams.
- **Delegated worker tokens.** Team service accounts can mint short-lived user-scoped tokens so self-hosted workers run attributed to a specific team member.
- **Interrupting keeps partial results.** Stopping a turn preserves the output of in-flight shell commands, and follow-ups move running tools to the background instead of killing them.

## April 2026

- **`/rewind`: undo agent turns.** An interactive timeline restores files and conversation state to any earlier turn, with per-turn file diffs, conversation-only restore, and `/undo`/`/restore` aliases (enable in `/config`).
- **Desktop notifications.** Get notified when a turn finishes or the agent is blocked on you (approvals, questions, sudo) across iTerm2, Ghostty, Warp, Kitty, and Terminal.app, with tmux/screen passthrough and focus-aware muting. Approval notifications include the pending command.
- **Interactive `/config`.** A full settings editor inside the CLI replaces hand-editing JSON, including a version and account page.
- **Custom status line.** Point `statusLine` at your own command and render its output (with live token usage data) in the prompt footer.
- **`/btw` side questions.** Ask a quick read-only question mid-turn; the answer streams into a dismissible overlay with full conversation context and never touches your conversation history.
- **Lighter startup.** MCP loading moved off the first-paint path, server config and model are cached between runs, the syntax-highlighting bundle shrank from 9.1 MB to 2.4 MB, and one-shot commands skip UI initialization entirely.
- **HTTP/2 connection pooling on by default.** Better throughput for parallel tool calls and subagents.
- **Vim find motions.** `f`/`F`/`t`/`T`/`;`/`,` with operator composition (`df,`, `ct.`).
- **Image paste shortcuts.** Ctrl+V pastes a clipboard image; pasting a copied image file resolves the actual image.
- **Markdown and diff rendering.** Tighter spacing, styled headings, git-style unified diffs with context lines, accurate new-file diffs, and a fix for gray-on-dark text that was invisible in many themes (including dark mode over SSH).
- **Context in the footer.** Working directory, git branch, and the open PR for your branch (as a clickable link) stay visible while you type.
- **`?` shortcut cheat sheet, `/copy`, `/rename`.** Discover input shortcuts, copy past messages, and name your sessions.
- **One question at a time.** Clarifying questions present individually with a freeform "Other" answer option.
- **Headless improvements.** `--format json` for `status`/`about`, plan mode works with `-p`, and errors are recorded in transcripts so scripts can detect failed runs.
- **Hooks fire reliably.** `afterAgentThought`/`afterAgentResponse` events emit in the CLI, and Claude Code-format hook responses are accepted.
- **Global MCP servers auto-approved.** Servers from `~/.cursor/mcp.json` load without per-workspace prompts (project-level servers still require approval), and MCP approval screens hide secrets in URLs.
- **Install plugins from a git URL.** Paste a repo URL into the plugin search to install directly.
- **Trust and approval hardening.** Worktrees inherit workspace trust, approval prompts can't be skipped by a stray Enter, and the CLI offers to persist "Run Everything" after repeated use.

## March 2026

- **Subagents in the CLI.** Parallel agents execute locally with live status in interactive, headless, and editor sessions, inheriting your credentials, rules, and approval policy. Max mode and custom-key setups propagate to subagents.
- **Run Everything is its own toggle.** Auto-approval is controlled by `/auto-run` (and `--force`/`--yolo`) separately from the Shift+Tab mode cycle, and team-configured approval modes are respected in headless runs.
- **Plugins arrived.** Browse the marketplace and install or uninstall plugins at user or project scope from `/plugin`; plugin skills, slash commands, subagents, and MCP servers all load into the session.
- **Retries on by default.** Dropped and stalled streams retry automatically in all modes, and classified server errors (like rate limits) render with their real message.
- **`permissions.json` support.** The CLI reads the same terminal/MCP allowlist file as the IDE.
- **Corporate proxy support for auth.** Login and API-key validation route through `HTTPS_PROXY`, unblocking Zscaler-style networks.
- **Background tasks.** Double Ctrl+B sends a running shell to the background, headless runs wait for background work to finish (emitting events for `stream-json` consumers), and completion notifications render cleanly.
- **Self-hosted worker improvements.** No sudo required, fixed idle disconnects, automatic token refresh, a Prometheus metrics endpoint, Windows support, custom names, and proxy support.
- **Skills from other tools' directories.** Skills are also discovered in `.claude/skills`, `.agents/skills`, and `.codex/skills`.
- **Remote MCP OAuth fixes.** Strict OAuth servers (state/scopes) work with `/mcp login`, and `${VAR}` placeholders expand in MCP configs everywhere.
- **`--image` everywhere.** Attach images in any session, not just print mode.
- **Editor integrations.** Model and mode selection over the Agent Client Protocol (Zed, JetBrains), host-provided MCP servers respected, richer streaming with thinking and file locations, and skill slash commands.
- **Locked macOS keychain detected over SSH.** A clear "unlock your keychain" message replaces opaque credential failures.
- **Admin controls.** Network allow and deny lists are enforced unconditionally (including for MCP traffic), admin-disabled sandboxing is respected by auto-run, and image generation asks before running.
- **Claude Sonnet 4.6 on Bedrock.** Added to the bring-your-own-key model list.
- **Richer hook payloads.** Per-turn token usage and a stable session ID.

## February 2026

- **Git worktrees.** `--worktree`/`-w` runs the agent in an isolated worktree (with `--worktree-base` for the base branch), keeping agent changes off your checkout; the sandbox fully understands worktree layouts.
- **Headless hang fixed.** `-p` runs no longer block when spawned with an open stdin pipe (Node, Python, CI runners), and connection failover on partially unreachable networks dropped from about 20 seconds to 8.
- **`--yolo`.** Fully autonomous runs that auto-approve consistently across trust, MCP, and command approvals.
- **AWS Bedrock with your own credentials.** `agent bedrock` configures access keys or a team IAM role; works across interactive, headless, and editor sessions.
- **Automatic reconnection.** Transport errors retry with a visible "Reconnecting…" indicator.
- **Review UI.** Unified `/changes` (Ctrl+R) with a Session tab showing only this session's edits, `o`/`O` to open diffs in your editor, and a zen toggle while reviewing.
- **Token usage for scripts.** Per-turn input/output/cache token totals and a `request_id` in `stream-json` output; headless transcripts write Claude Code-compatible JSONL.
- **Repeatable `-H/--header`.** Pass multiple headers curl-style.
- **Sandbox policy files.** `~/.cursor/sandbox.json` and `.cursor/sandbox.json` are honored (including over SSH), network access has clear modes, and the CLI fails fast with a clear reason when sandboxing is enabled but unavailable.
- **Plan mode improvements.** A persistent plan menu with Build Locally / Build in Cloud, and plan content transfers correctly to cloud agents.
- **Faster startup, snappier turns.** Parallelized initialization, deferred update checks, and optimistic message rendering.
- **Rendering improvements.** Markdown tables wrap to your terminal width, thinking blocks render markdown, shell commands get syntax highlighting, and Mermaid renders more diagram types.
- **Input fixes across terminals.** Vim `r` (replace char), Alt+Delete word deletion, Ctrl+J newline in iTerm2, Windows Delete key, Wayland clipboard support, and session-local prompt history.
- **Enterprise attribution control.** Admin-disabled commit/PR attribution is enforced in the CLI regardless of local settings.
- **Clear errors for blocked screenshots.** macOS permission failures show a warning and workaround instead of failing silently.

## January 2026

- **Hooks.** Session start/end, stop hooks with follow-up loops (autonomous "keep going" patterns), pre-compaction, and subagent lifecycle hooks; Claude Code `settings.json` hooks are read and merged; admins can push team-managed hooks with enterprise > team > project > user precedence.
- **Permissions and sandboxing aligned with the IDE.** A three-mode model (Run Everything / Auto-Run in Sandbox / Ask Every Time), an interactive `/sandbox` menu, a default-deny network proxy for sandboxed commands, and team-admin network allowlists enforced in the CLI.
- **`sudo` works.** Commands needing sudo trigger a masked password prompt delivered over a locked-down local socket; the model never sees your password.
- **Plan and Ask modes.** `--mode plan|ask` startup flags, `/plan <prompt>`, Shift+Tab mode cycling, and native UIs for questions, mode switches, and plan review, with plans saved to disk.
- **Responsive typing while streaming.** Buffered input with deferred rendering of streaming output, and queued follow-ups submit instantly.
- **Hand off to Cloud Agents.** Type `&` to transfer the live conversation to a cloud agent and keep working.
- **`--continue`.** Resume your most recent chat without looking up an ID; transcripts persist to disk for tooling and hooks.
- **Headless trust enforcement.** Non-interactive runs in untrusted workspaces fail with guidance unless `--trust` (or `--force`) is passed.
- **MCP management.** `/mcp list` is an interactive pager with status, login, enable, and tool browsing; OAuth login fixed; project config correctly overrides user config; tool-level allowlisting from the approval prompt.
- **Skills, rules, and commands in the CLI.** `/skills` browsing and inline `/skill-name` invocation, curated built-in skills, and interactive `/rules` and `/commands` browsers with inline editing.
- **`/model` autocomplete and Max Mode.** Fuzzy model search with friendly names, plus `/max-mode` with a footer indicator that persists across sessions.
- **Markdown rendering.** Aligned tables, clickable links, horizontal rules, and word-level inline diffs in file reviews.
- **Subagent UI.** Live rendering for parallel subagents with per-agent status, streamed activity, and token counts.
- **Editor integration groundwork.** Session resume, real agent modes, granular tool rendering, and custom slash commands over the Agent Client Protocol (Zed and others).
- **Windows reliability.** Works under restricted PowerShell execution policies, detects Git Bash, fixes browser-based login; clipboard support landed on Windows and Linux.
- **Auth and updates.** Expired tokens prompt re-login instead of crashing, transient server errors no longer log you out, parallel auto-updates can't corrupt an install, and `--disable-auto-update` turns background updates off.
- **Faster startup.** Compile caching and lazy initialization cut warm boot time about 10%.
