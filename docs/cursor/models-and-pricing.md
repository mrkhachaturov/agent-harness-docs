# Models & Pricing

Cursor supports frontier models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, SpaceXAI, and more. Every individual plan includes two usage pools so you can pick the right balance of intelligence, speed, and cost.

## Usage pools

There are two separate usage pools for individual plans, each resetting with your monthly billing cycle:

- **First-party models**: Significantly more included usage with Composer 2.5 and Grok 4.5.
- **API**: Charged at the model's API price. Individual plans include at least $20 of API usage each month (more on higher tiers) with the option to pay for additional usage as needed.

Both pools are visible in your editor settings and on your [usage dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard/usage).

## First-party models pool

The First-party models pool includes Composer 2.5 and Grok 4.5.

### Composer pricing

Composer 2.5 is Cursor's own model, trained to be highly capable for agentic coding.

### Grok 4.5 pricing

Grok 4.5 is jointly trained by Cursor and SpaceXAI for long-running coding and knowledge work.

## API pool

When you select a specific model, usage is drawn from the API pool at that model's API rate.

### Model pricing

All prices are per million tokens:

Opting in to regional data residency incurs a 10% uplift on Model pricing for eligible Models. See [Privacy and Data Governance](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/privacy-and-data-governance.md) for details on supported regions, Models, functions and data residency policies.

## Plans

All individual plans include unlimited tab completions, extended agent usage limits on all models, access to Bugbot, and access to Cloud Agents.

| Plan         | Price   | API usage included | First-party models pool |
| :----------- | :------ | :----------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Pro**      | $20/mo  | $20                | Generous included usage |
| **Pro Plus** | $60/mo  | $70                | Generous included usage |
| **Ultra**    | $200/mo | $400               | Generous included usage |

Since different models have different API costs, your model selection affects how quickly your included usage is consumed.

### How much usage do I need?

- **Daily Tab users**: Always stay within $20
- **Limited Agent users**: Often stay within the included $20
- **Daily Agent users**: Typically $60–$100/mo total usage
- **Power users (multiple agents/automation)**: Often $200+/mo total usage

### What happens when I reach my limit?

When you exceed your included monthly usage, you can either:

- **Add on-demand usage**: Continue at the same API rates with pay-as-you-go billing
- **Upgrade your plan**: Move to a higher tier for more included usage

On-demand usage is billed monthly at the same rates. Requests are never downgraded in quality or speed.

### Teams

There are two business plans: Teams and Enterprise (Custom). Teams offers two seat types: Standard ($40/user/mo) and Premium ($120/user/mo), where Premium adds 5x the Standard limits on Agent.

Team plans provide additional features like centralized team billing and administration, a team marketplace for internal rules, skills, and plugins, agentic code reviews with Bugbot, cloud agents and automations with shared team context, usage analytics, team-wide privacy mode enforcement, and SAML/OIDC SSO.

We recommend Teams for any customer that is happy self-serving. We recommend [Enterprise](https://cursor.com/contact-sales?source=docs-models-pricing) for customers that need priority support, pooled usage, invoicing, SCIM, or advanced security controls.

Learn more about [Teams pricing](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/pricing.md).

## Cursor Token Rate

On Teams and Enterprise plans, third-party model requests include a Cursor Token Rate of $0.25 per million tokens. This rate applies on top of model API pricing for included usage, on-demand usage, and BYOK usage.

The Cursor Token Rate applies when you select a third-party model directly, and when Auto Balance or Auto Intelligence routes to a third-party model. Auto Cost and all first-party models, including Composer 2.5 and Grok 4.5, are exempt from the Cursor Token Rate.

## Auto modes

Auto has three modes: Auto Cost, Auto Balance, and Auto Intelligence.

### Auto Cost

Auto Cost pricing is set per million tokens, regardless of which model is used.

| Token type          | Price per 1M tokens |
| :------------------ | :------------------ |
| Input + Cache Write | $1.25               |
| Output              | $6.00               |
| Cache Read          | $0.25               |

### Auto Balance and Auto Intelligence

Auto Balance and Auto Intelligence are charged at Model API rates for the model used, based on actual usage. Third-party models also incur the Cursor Token Rate. See [Model pricing](https://cursor.com/docs/models-and-pricing.md#model-pricing) for per-model rates.

## Legacy request-based pricing

### Max Mode

Max Mode is available only on legacy request-based plans. It extends a model's context window beyond the default limit and is billed at the model's API rate plus 20%. See [Max Mode on legacy plans](https://cursor.com/help/ai-features/max-mode.md) for details.

## FAQ

### Where are models hosted?

Models are hosted on US, Canada, & Iceland based infrastructure by the model's provider, a trusted partner, or Cursor directly. For details, see our list of [sub-processors](https://trust.cursor.com/subprocessors).

### Where can I find pricing terms?

For enterprise pricing details, billing terms, and fee calculations, see the [Pricing Policy](https://cursor.com/terms/pricing).
